The Lonely Scarecrow and the Tragic Friendship,"This is the story of 13-year-old Rumi, who lived with her father in a village. Her mother, who was her best friend, died due to a disease a few years ago, and since then she started feeling very lonely. She also did not have many friends in school, and being small in height, all the children of her class used to bother her all the time, but that night her life changed forever. That day, the children of her class made fun of her so much that she had a fight with one of them. All the children started running after Rumi to harm her. School children were looking for her everywhere. Due to which her father took her to a farm to avoid them, she went on that path and did not know that she is heading to the middle of that field. She saw a scarecrow whose eyes were staring at her in the suns light. Seeing the scarecrow there, she realized that she had come to a field where there are no shortcuts because the whole village knew that if anyone is going to that field, they might lose their life at the hands of that scarecrow. She was standing there to see him that the boys who were following her reached there, and they surrounded her from all sides. They scared her, knowing what was going to happen to her, so she gave up her eyes and closed her eyes before she was beaten by those boys. She started crying at the same time, but when she opened her eyes, she saw that her school boys were falling on the ground, and their hands were deeply hurt. Her condition had become so bad due to nervousness that she turned in shock and went straight to sleep. Whatever happened in that field, she was thinking about the same lying on the bed at night. But she could not understand why the scarecrow did not kill her, and thinking this, she lost her eyes.

Late that night, she was completely sleepy, and she saw that the scarecrow was staring at her with the same white eyes from the other side of her room's window, but before she could do something, the scarecrow also put the hand inside the window and grabbed her hand. She started coming quickly, but still, she started seeing the scene of a small child who was going to the same field looking for his ball. Being of low caste, some upper-caste people killed the child with sticks to enter their fields, and to hide his murder, they filled the body of the child inside a scarecrow. Seeing all this, she understood that the scarecrow was actually a small child who probably wanted to be her friend. Knowing his story, she and the scarecrow became friends, but due to the children in the village, last night her father, who was a pundit, was called to cleanse the souls of those children because everyone's parents feared that the scarecrow would fall behind their children and kill those children. On the other hand, she and her new friend started spending a lot of time together. Wherever she went, she would play many games with her forces, and she would bring new clothes and toys to him.

A few days later, when her birthday came, the children of her class started fighting with her again, and that fight increased so much that one of them started making fun of her mother's death. Due to which she got so angry, she hit the ball next to the boy's head and ran away. She ran behind the school after which something happened due to which the whole village was shocked because that night, those children of her class were also found with straw hands and ripped chests. The whole school gathered there due to the sound of those children’s shouting, and when they looked around, the scarecrow had disappeared from there. After the death of those children all the villagers thought that today they would burn the scarecrow and end it forever. They started looking for the scarecrow, but they could not find it anywhere. She was not at home when her father returned home at night. Even after looking around, he could not see her anywhere. He was very scared, and with a torch in his hand, he started searching for her everywhere. When she was not found anywhere, he became tired and sat down at his wife's favorite place and started crying in grief for losing his daughter. He felt that the scarecrow had taken his daughter somewhere.

Then he heard Rumi's voice and saw that she was with the same scarecrow. He did not know that Rumi had rescued the scarecrow herself from the villagers. She was talking to him when her father came in front of them with a torch, and he started moving forward to save his daughter. Before he could do anything, the scarecrow held him with his straw hands. She shouted and begged him to leave her father, but the scarecrow would not let go. So she picked up a fallen torch and set her best friend on fire to save her father. The burning scarecrow left her father's grip, but by then, her father's breath was already gone. That night she became even lonelier because she lost two people forever.

After that tragic night, Rumi was filled with guilt and grief. She couldn't forgive herself for what she had done to her friend, who had only wanted to protect her. She became withdrawn and stopped talking to anyone. She couldn't even bear to look at the field where she had burned her friend. Her father's death had also left her feeling alone and lost. He had been her only family and the one who had always been there for her. She didn't know how to cope without him. Days turned into weeks, and weeks turned into months, but Rumi remained in a state of mourning. She had lost everything that had mattered to her, and she didn't know how to move forward. She would often sit by her father's favourite spot and cry for hours. But then one day, something strange happened. As she was crying, she heard a faint whisper in her ear. She turned around to see the scarecrow standing behind her. She was terrified at first, but then she realized that it was not the same scarecrow that she had burned. This scarecrow had a different aura, and it seemed to radiate kindness.

The scarecrow spoke to her and told her that it was okay to grieve but that she needed to let go of her guilt. It told her that her friend had forgiven her and that she needed to forgive herself too. The scarecrow also told her that her father was proud of her and that he was always watching over her. As Rumi listened to the scarecrow's words, she felt a sense of peace wash over her. She realized that she needed to let go of her past and move forward. She thanked the scarecrow for its words of wisdom and walked back to her house with a newfound sense of hope.

From that day on, she started to heal. She began to talk to her classmates and made new friends. She even started visiting the field again, but this time, she was not afraid. She knew that her friend, the scarecrow, was watching over her and protecting her. Years passed, and Rumi grew up to be an independent lady. She never forgot the lessons she had learned from her friend, the scarecrow. She knew that life was full of hardships, but she also knew that she had the strength to overcome them. She left her village to pursue her dreams, but she always carried the memory of her friend, the scarecrow, with her. It had taught her the most valuable lesson of all: to always believe in oneself and to never give up, no matter how difficult life may seem.",kids
Spiritual Love,"This is a boy named Jun, who had always been different from other boys his age. From a young age, he could see ghosts. While most people would be terrified by this ability, Jun found comfort in it. He saw the spirits of loved ones who had passed away and the lost souls who wandered aimlessly through the streets. As Jun grew older, he began to feel more and more isolated. His ability made it difficult for him to connect with other people, and he found himself spending most of his time alone. But then, one day, he saw her - a beautiful woman sitting on a bench in the park. Her name was Hana. She was unlike any ghost that Jun had ever seen before. She was beautiful, indeed, but there was something else about her - a sadness that tugged at his heart. Jun felt drawn to her, and he knew that he had to help her in any way he could. Over the next few weeks, he visited her every day. They talked about life, death, and everything in between. She told him about her past, about the man she had loved and lost, and about her deep loneliness in the afterlife. As they spent more time together, he found himself falling love with Hana. He knew that their love could never be fully realized, but he couldn't help how he felt. Hana, too, began to feel a connection with him. He was the first person who had truly seen her in years, and she was grateful for his companionship.

One day, he decided to do something for her. He went to a priest and asked if there was any way to bring Hana back to life. The priest told him that there was a ritual that could do it, but it required a sacrifice. he knew what he had to do. He offered his own life in exchange for Hana's. The ritual was performed, and miraculously, Hana came back to life. Jun, on the other hand, passed away.

Hana was overwhelmed with emotion. She could feel Jun's love and his sacrifice, and she knew that he had given his life for her. She could sense his presence even though he was gone, and she knew that their love would transcend time and space. She lived the rest of her life with a deep appreciation for the sacrifice that Jun had made for her. She knew that his love was unique and special, and that their bond would never be broken. And so, she lived every day in gratitude, knowing that she had been given a second chance at life thanks to Jun who could see ghosts and understand there feelings and in an emotions..

As you know that love knows no boundaries, not even death. It also highlights the importance of selflessness and sacrifice in relationships. As you seen Jun's willingness to sacrifice his own life for Hana's shows that true love is about putting the needs and happiness of the other person before one's own.",kids
lost in the cemetry,"Whirling winds on this cold October evening sent chills down my back. I found myself wandering around a cemetery, which I had no idea how I got there. The cemetery was huge. I couldn’t see an exit, for what seemed like miles long.

A shaky and deep voice called out, “What are you doing in this abandoned cemetery?”

Abandoned? I thought.

“Yes, abandoned.” The voice answered as if they could read my mind.

By then, I was a bit freaked out. I ran along the paths, desperate to find an exit to go home. But, after what seemed like an hour of running, I started to think that this was a no exit cemetery, or maybe I am stuck in a world of gravestones. But, a better idea was that I was just dreaming, and I had to wake up somehow. I don’t think that’s a true thought though, because everything around me is so real, I can feel the wind, I can hear voices, I can smell salty air…

Wait, salty air?! Then I must be close to an ocean of some sort! My thoughts were exploding from my head.

Now, my goal was to get to an ocean, but I’d need to escape this cemetery first. And I don’t think that’s happening anytime soon.



The sky was now darker, almost pitch black. My eyelids were getting heavy. I felt I couldn’t keep them open any longer. So I closed them, just to rest a bit. And I definitely wasn’t ready to witness what happened next.

I was dreaming, a pale lady with dark hair approached me. She had an evil grin on her face, and had a filthy, brown, rag as her clothes. She looked down on me and said,

“This is an evil place, escape while you can.”


When I woke up the next morning, I could barely remember that dream. But, I remembered what the lady had said. This is an evil place, escape while you can. I could still hear the words repeating in my head. I’m actually scared now.

Escape? I thought, if I can’t even find an exit, how will I get out of here? Will I die? I need to calm myself.

I breathed slowly, I wasn’t completely calm, (obviously, I still had that evil looking lady stuck in my head,) but I was better than before.

I started slowly wandering around gravestones, looking at each name. Claire? That’s my name! And..the grave is open. Are they planning to kill me? Just then, someone jumps on me, pinning me to the ground.

This is it. I thought, I’m getting killed, murdered. What should I do? Just let them do their thing?

“I’m surprised you’re not scared.” The person said calmly.

They stood up and looked down at me. I turned around and was shocked. So shocked I couldn’t move or speak until about 30 seconds later.

“Claire McDougall? How are you here?” I finally asked.

“I got here the same way you did” She responded.

I told her about the evil looking lady, and Claire was freaked out even more than me.


Night had fallen and we were staring at the sky, looking for Autumn constellations. Eventually, I said,

“Hey Claire, I found the Cassiopeia constellation!”

No one responded. Not even a single cricket. All I heard was the wind blowing around me. I turned around and Claire was gone.

That’s odd…I thought, Claire was literally sitting behind me the entire time..

Little did I know, she was sitting behind me, as a ghost. She was killed when I was too busy looking for stars. And that open grave was for Claire McDougall, not Claire Lu.

Suddenly, the ground below me started shaking and I heard obnoxious yelling. I closed my eyes and covered my ears. But, when I opened my eyes again, I was in a little cottage in the woods…

What do I do now?

The Ghostly Figure
(Part 2 of Lost in the Cemetery)

It was a dark and stormy night when I found myself in a cottage after witnessing Claire McDougall’s death. That was when I saw a ghostly figure outside my window. It was pitch black, it had glowing red eyes, and was about six feet tall. It stared right into my eyes before going back into the forest.

I must be hallucinating. I thought.

But I wasn’t, that thing was actually there. I went to bed, hoping I could forget what just happened and move on to other things. I was wrong. I closed my eyes and imagined I was back at home. But, instead, I found myself in a dark room with nothing but a red glow of light. It was the creature.

“Why hello there” the creature thundered, while he shook the whole room.

“W-what do you want?” I stuttered with fear, while grasping onto whatever I could find. Which was nothing, so I fell backwards towards the ground.

The creature went silent. It was like it didn’t know how to answer, or like it didn’t understand what I asked. So I asked again. But this time I spoke bravely.

“What do you want??” I said, almost shouting, while standing up and brushing the dust off my sweater.

This time, it did answer. It gave an unexpected answer.

“I don’t really need anything….”

W-what? What’s THAT supposed to mean?? I thought.

There was an awkward silence that lasted about two minutes. We were just standing there, staring at each other. The red glowing eyes faded to a pale yellow, and they became shorter. About the height of an average sixth grader. It looked at me, turned around and picked something up. A trigger was pulled and I was shot dead.

(This is the bad ending, if you wish for the good ending, keep reading.)


Friendly Ghosts
(Part 3 of Lost in the Cemetery)

I was a ghost, I had no legs and best of all, I could fly. I flew out of the room, finding that it was some sort of a secret bunker. I eventually found the gigantic cemetery that I was stuck in days before. I found Claire McDougall sitting there in the darkness.

“Hi Claire!” I said happily.

“AAAH” she yelled, “Oh it’s only you.”

We laughed for a while, but she then questioned how I died. We talked together about what we did the past few days. Claire has gone casually haunting people with random gorilla noises. The best thing I did was to throw a rock in someone’s face. They were freaked out and screamed their way home.

But, not everything goes well. In one thunderstorm Claire got shocked with lightning and was thrown up into the air beyond Earth and landed on Mars. I stole one of NASA’s rocket ships and I flew to Mars to find Claire. We were going to live on Mars forever and ever until the day we’re thrown back to Earth. I don’t think that’s going to happen very soon.",kids
friendships around the world,"I have disabilities and I am doing a project for disabilities awareness month. And this is my project story called Friends around the world for people with disabilities. Friendship is an essential part of life and is often even more important for people with disabilities. People with disabilities can feel excluded and isolated from their peers due to physical or mental impairments, but friendship can be a powerful force in helping them cope with the challenges of disability.

Thankfully, there are now many networks and organizations that promote meaningful connections between people with disabilities and their peers around the world. For example, World Enabled is a global organization that works to foster inclusion for people with disabilities through leadership training, advocacy, and increased access to education and employment opportunities. Through their efforts, they create communities of friendship and support that bridge cultural differences and create understanding.

Similarly, FRIENDS International is a network of organizations working with people with disabilities in countries around the world. They have programs designed to help individuals learn social skills and develop relationships through mentorship, group activities, and peer support.

In addition, many online programs and chatrooms are available, providing access to a worldwide community of friendship and understanding when other forms of connection might be difficult.

Overall, there are many ways that people with disabilities are able to make friends and form meaningful connections around the world. Whether online or in person, friendships built around common interests, experiences, and understanding can not only provide comfort and support to those with disabilities, but can also help break down barriers and create a more inclusive society.",kids
true love,"As the moon came over the palace, a chill swept through the air. Cathy had always been fascinated by the stories of the old house and the ghostly legends that surrounded it. So, when she received an invitation to spend the night there, she couldn't resist. As she walked through the creaky halls, she felt an inexplicable presence that seemed to follow her every step. Suddenly, she heard a voice whisper her name. She turned around, but no one was there. Despite the eerie feeling, Cathy was drawn to a particular room. As she entered, she felt a strange sensation that made her skin tingle. In the center of the room, she saw a portrait of a man. He had a striking resemblance to someone she had seen before. Suddenly, the room filled with a gust of cold wind, and Cathy saw the painting come to life. The man stepped out of the frame and stood in front of her.

""My dear Cathy, I have been waiting for you for so long,"" he said.

home care,"Gary had just started a new job but was too embarrassed to tell his friends about it. It was something that'd always interested him and one night after leaving a job on a building site; he decided to take the risk and apply for this one. On his first day, Gary was nervous. It was an early start, and it was still dark when a car pulled up in front of his house. For the next few days, he'd be shown the ropes and if he was any good, they'd take him on permanently. He got into the vehicle and a woman in her twenties turned to him and said, ""I don't mean to be rude, but you look petrified. Once you know what you're doing, you'll love it. We have some really sweet clients. It's a very rewarding job. So, are you ready for a day of making beds, clearing up poo and making cups of tea?"" She laughed.
  Gary didn't know what to think, then replied, ""Mum always said I'd be good at this, so I thought I'd give it a try.""
  The woman with long blonde hair started the engine. ""I think you're very brave for giving it a go. And honestly, you've nothing to worry about. Your mum will be very proud. Shall we be off? The first client is a lovely lady by the name of Glenda, who lives on the other side of the city.""
  ""Yes, that sounds good. By the way, what's your name?"" he asked.
  ""Stephanie, and it's nice to meet you, Gary.""
  The car then moved slowly up the road.

  The woman of 91 was in bed when the two of them arrived. They used a special code to enter the premises. 
  Gary followed Stephanie into the living room where there was a machine that could lift people into a standing position, which came in handy if you needed to move someone.
   She demonstrated how it worked, then pushed it into the bedroom to the side of the bed. Stephanie touched the lady's shoulder gently. 
  The woman looked up at her and smiled. ""Hello, my lovely. Is it time to go into the living room?""
  ""Yes, it is, Glenda. Did you sleep well, sweetheart?"" Stephanie asked.
  ""I slept like a baby,"" she answered.
  With care, Stephanie, with Gary's assistance, positioned the lady at the side of the bed, then Glenda grabbed two handles in front of her while they wrapped a hoist just under her arms, connecting the hoist straps to the machine. With a push of a button, the elderly woman was lifted safely into a standing position. At the end of the bed was a wheelchair that they lowered her in to.
  Stephanie crouched down, so she was the same height as Glenda, gave her a smile, then said, ""Are you comfy, sweetheart?""
  ""Yes, I'm fine,"" was all she answered before falling asleep.
  Stephanie touched her hand softly. ""Bless her.""
  Gary was taken aback by how Stephanie was with the frail woman, like she genuinely cared. It was so heartwarming to see. 
  ""Gary, could you push her into the living room please, then I'll show you how we put her into the chair. Every person we deal with is different, but you'll learn as we go along. Are you okay with that?""
  ""Anything you need and I'm here to help the best I can,"" he replied. 
  She looked happy about this. ""Thank you, Gary.""

  Twenty minutes later, both left the house after she was safely in the living room and Gary had made her a nice cup of tea. In about two hours, Glenda's daughter, who was retired, would pop round to do housework and keep her company for a little while. A lot of elderly people didn't have anyone and the carers that popped in 4 times a day were the only people they'd see. It was heartbreaking.

  The next client was a man in his eighties who, like Glenda, had mobility issues. Gary liked him straightaway while he chatted about what he did as a job years ago which was a bouncer in London in the sixties and before that he'd joined the army and had many near misses, so he was quite happy to still be here in one piece. He was a jovial character with lots to talk about.

  Stephanie had warned Gary about the third client, who was still relatively young compared to the rest, only being 67. Years ago, this poor fella had been involved in a motorbike accident which resulted in him losing both legs. He had a wheelchair to get about, but spent most of his time at home. He suffered from depression and his moods were changeable. At the entrance to the place, Stephanie rang the doorbell. Within moments, the door was unlocked and opened. In the hallway sat a man in his wheelchair. 
  ""Hello, Stephanie,"" he said. ""I see you've got a new chap with you.""
  ""Hello, David. Yes, he started today. I'm showing him the ropes. How do you feel?"" she asked, looking concerned.
  He gave a long sigh, then replied, ""I've been better. I won't lie. If it wasn't for you guys coming round, I wouldn't see anyone. I do appreciate it, you know. Would you like to come in?""
  ""Yes, that would be lovely,"" she said.
  They followed the man into the living room.
  ""So, what can we do for you today, David?"" Stephanie asked.
  The man started to cry. Between tears he said. ""I just need a friendly voice to talk to for a little while. Do you mind?""
  Stephanie placed a hand on his shoulder. ""No, of course I don't mind. Tell me anything you want. If it helps, then I'm more than happy to be here for you.""
  David looked up at her. ""Thank you.""

    They left the house later than expected.
  ""That was a nice thing you did in there,"" Gary said, impressed with her.
  ""It comes with the job, mate. You'll learn that in time. By the way, do you like it so far? I do understand it's not everyone's cup of tea, talking of tea. I could literally murder a nice cup of tea right now.""
  Once they'd reached the car, Gary turned to her. ""I think I'm going to love this job. It's just a feeling I have. It's like you in there with David. I've never seen anything like that before. This job has everything. How could you not like it?""
  ""That's good to hear, mate. I told you, didn't I.""
  ""Yes you did.""  

  It was a half an hour journey to the fourth client who was another man in his late seventies who'd recently come out of hospital. The sad thing was the man named Larry had dementia. He was house bound and didn't have any family nearby. They talked to him and made him a hot drink while doing some housework and changing his bed, also checking his sugar levels because he had type 1 diabetes.

  Another fifteen minute journey to the last client of the morning was a woman of 87 who usually needed a bit of shopping done and to sort her tablets out. She was in the early stages of Alzhiemers and needed that little of help.

  All the morning visits had been completed, and it was 9.32am. 
  ""Fancy getting a bite to eat, Gary? We have about two hours until the lunch time visits begin where we can head back to the sweet lady from the first visit."" Stephanie said. ""Or if you prefer me to take you back home. It's your decision?""
  His stomach rumbled. ""Food it is. I'm famished. Once I get used to the routine, I might head back home between shifts to catch up on certain things. Not sure yet.""
  Stephanie turned to him and smiled. ""Good decision, mate.""
 

  The rest of the day carried on without too many problems, where they visited the five clients at lunchtime, teatime, and early evening for various tasks. Gary would be lying if he didn't admit to himself that he enjoyed it very much. He got back home at 9.12pm quite tired. It'd been a long day


  By the end of the week, Gary had worked four days on the trot. Tomorrow, which happened to be a Saturday, was his day off. The plan was to meet up with his mates and to tell them about his new job. Gary didn't care what they thought anymore. He loved the job, as it was so fulfilling. He loved the people he worked with and, more importantly, he cared very much for the clients. To help them in their hour of need meant the world to him. And that was the most important thing.

high heels,"When I was a teenager, I was invited to a formal dance party at my school. I was excited to attend, but also nervous about what to wear. My mother suggested I wear high heels to complete my outfit. I had never worn high heels before, but I agreed to give it a try.

Mom, I don't know if I can wear these,"" I said, feeling unsure.

""Don't worry, sweetie, you'll get the hang of it. Just take small steps and keep your weight centered,"" she suggested..and added,

""Trust me, honey, you'll look stunning in these,"" my mother said, handing me the pair of shiny black heels.

As soon as I put on the heels, I felt like a different person. I was suddenly taller and more sophisticated. However, my excitement quickly turned into embarrassment when I realized I had no idea how to walk in them. I stumbled and wobbled around, trying to maintain my balance.

By the way, my mom was a huge confidential mindend lady. She again repeated,

""Come on, sweetie, don't be afraid to try new things. You'll do great,"" my mother encouraged me.

As I arrived at the party, I tried to play it cool and act like everything was fine. But as soon as I stepped onto the dance floor, disaster struck. I lost my balance and tripped over my own feet, falling to the ground in front of everyone. I was mortified.

""Are you okay?"" Lily asked, concerned.

""I'm fine, I'm fine,"" I said, feeling my face turn red with embarrassment and acted as a confidential teeny girls. In think in that ages everyone's confidence raises high.

Trying to hide my embarrassment, I quickly got up and laughed it off, pretending like it was no big deal. But deep down, I was humiliated and wanted to disappear.

My best friend Lilly helped me to tackle that incident and manage me another high heels as a support so that nobody would understood my hesitation. But a little bit causion continued in my mind.

When i returned my home, without checking me, my mother came up to me and asked, ""How are you doing, honey?""

""I don't know, Mom. I feel like a complete fool,"" I said, feeling down and pointed to my heels.

""It's okay, sweetheart.

You tried something new, and it didn't go as planned. But that's how we learn and grow. Don't be too hard on yourself,"" my mother said, giving me a hug.

From that day forward, I learned to embrace my true self and not worry too much about what other people thought. I stuck to flats and wore what I felt comfortable in, and I never forgot the valuable lesson my mother taught me that day.",kids
finding the meaning of life isnt easy,"What is the one thing in a person's life that they want the most? though everyone might have different answers they all give each person a similar feeling of peace and self-worth, a moment when they realize this what they truly want in life, this what they want their life to be filled with, something or someone who makes them feel complete and as if they found themselves or like the meaning of their life.

I have always thought I would be able to find that something or someone once I grew older, that I once I grow older I will become the best version of myself and that I'll just have to wait for it. But what I realized recently is that you shouldn't wait you should start preparing or training for it now itself.

When you turn older its not like you'll just magically turn into the to best version of yourself overnight. Becoming the best version of yourself and reaching the moment when you feel like you found the purpose of your life takes time, you need to start changing and step by step train yourself to be the best version of you and then eventually at your peak you'll find your destination after your long journey in life.

But you shouldn't stop there, and you probably wont, unless you die at the moment you find the purpose of your life. you should believe that there is never a full stop to your success only commas, ""Success Is Never Ending And Failure Is Never Final"" quoted by Robert H. Schuller.

This coming from a 15 year old might not be believable but it's just something I have realized over the course of time, Because currently I am on my way to that moment, and even though I still keep loosing my way and getting lost, But I still am trying to reach the best version of myself and I hope the readers understand what I am trying to say.",kids
dream big,"What a rushed morning I was having. With a toast in my mouth, I picked up my six year old daughter in one hand, grabbed my bag and car keys in the other and rushed out of the door. I had to drop off my daughter at her school before rushing to the office. I had a big presentation with my New York clients today and if I got it right, I might even get a promotion. I dropped my daughter at school and headed to work.
As I sat in my car nervous and irritated at the same time, cursing the Mumbai traffic, my mind wandered to the early days, when life was not so rushed . I thought back of the times when I lived a slow-paced life with not much to do. My name is Sapna which means dreams in Hindi but ironically when I was younger, I was never actually allowed to dream.
I was born and brought up in Lucknow. I grew up in a large family with four siblings. I had two brothers and we were three sisters. My father was a businessman and was a wholesaler who supplied grains to small shops in Lucknow. Only a kilometer away from our house, there was a local school where all the children of the area studied. I would go everyday with my siblings to school. I had a lot of friends at school and I loved to learn and study. But when my sisters and I reached the 8th standard, my father decided that as long as we had learnt to read and write, that was enough education for the girls. He did not allow us to go to school any further. Of course my mother had no say in the matter. Like all other women, all her life she too had just lived in the shadow of my father with no real opinion of her own. I wanted to pursue finance and learn about the startings of a business, but my parents had other plans for my sisters and me. “Running a business is a man’s job”, my father would often say. Our parents forced us to learn all the different household chores because according to them, girls needed to learn how to run a house, not a business. “If you study too much, it would be difficult to get you married”, they would say.
Their plans for us included getting us married into good wealthy families instead of pursuing our dreams. So, my sisters and I learned all the different household chores while our brothers continued their studies to be successful in life. We learned the different household chores from doing the dishes, laundry , cooking and making perfect round “rotis”. But my mind was never there, I never just wanted this with my life, I wanted to study to live in Delhi, to explore the world, not just spend my entire life in this small little town.
At the age of 18, my brothers started learning how to drive. “ You should know how to drive, it will help you move around the city”, my father would tell them. I asked my father if he could teach me how to drive as well. His reaction has me alarmed to this day. Instead of being supportive or teaching me to drive, all he said was “Girls don’t drive, your future husband will take you wherever you want to go. You don’t need to learn how to drive. Go help your mother with the household chores” he said laughing alongside my brothers. I couldn’t believe how many things us girls were not allowed to do that boys could without any hesitation.
I had only just turned 18, when my parents decided to get me married so I could start a family. All my crying and protesting made no difference at all. “We have three daughters to marry, the sooner you get married, we can start looking for grooms for the others” my father said. My parents got me married to a boy from Lucknow itself. His name was Raj and he worked at the local packaging factory. The preparations for the wedding did not include much. We simply called a pandit at home, there were a few sweets and fruits. It was a small celebration in the house with not a lot of people. It was more like a formality than a wedding. Only in a few days I had to pack everything and move to start living with my husband while my brothers went to Delhi to start college.
Even at my husband’s house, my opinion never mattered. I was never consulted for big discussions. I was like a puppet who danced to fulfill her husband’s orders. The next two years were very monotonous for me, all I did was cook, clean and repeat. Everyday was like the day before. Then, my in-laws started talking about me having a baby. At the young age of 20 I was already a mother. All my time would go looking after the baby from then on. I never got any free time, every ounce of my energy was spent with the baby whom we named Gudiya. Two years passed in a flash.
Then, one evening, Raj came home from work, he was exhausted but I could see a big smile on his face. As he sat down to tell me about his day, he told me the best news ever. Raj’s factory was expanding and setting up a new factory in Mumbai, and he was asked to go to Mumbai to overlook the operations there. This meant we would be shifting from Lucknow to Mumbai - the city of dreams (sapne) . I could feel my face pulling into a grin.
The next day, Raj had a day away from the factory, so we started packing our clothes to move. Raj’s parents liked it here so, Raj, Gudiya and I would move to Mumbai for this new job. I thought I would take this as an opportunity to do something with my life, maybe fulfill my own dreams and get a job in Mumbai.
When we reached Mumbai, for the first few months, the situation of our house remained the same. I was not given a say in any of the family matters. I was still not treated properly. By this time Gudiya had turned 3 and was ready for school. I knew that I would give her everything that I did not have in my childhood. I would not let the same things happen for her. She would finish her education in a good school and decide what she wanted in her life, and my daughter would fulfill her dreams. The world was changing. Women were required to give more meaning to their lives. I was going to let my daughter have a voice of her own. I found a good school and got her admission. When I would take Gudiya to the park to play, I would see other women, dressed confidently with laptops, while I sat there in my salwar kameez and a sorry face. What was I being apologetic about? Was it my fault? I wanted a life like these women had. I decided I had had enough, I needed to take charge of my life. Sitting at home, I did an English speaking course to improve my communication. Only after a few weeks my English became better and I was able to communicate properly. Having done this course, I pleaded with Raj to let me join a call center to work instead. Seeing how I had nothing to do, he agreed that it would be good to have some additional income, Mumbai being an expensive city. The good thing about shifting to a bigger city was that at least Raj’s mindset had started to change and he agreed to me working. Raj bought a new car and I realized that now was the time to fulfill my other dream- my dream of driving, just like my brothers. I also did driving courses to learn how to drive and finally got my drivers license as well. I could finally prove my father wrong, and show him that even women could drive.
I would drive Gudiya to school in the mornings and then go to the call station. I got much better at my communication skills. I was a fast learner. Now that I had got the opportunities, I was going to do everything in my capacity to make it big, I was going to work hard. Then, I decided to apply for another job. Being good with communication, I started working in a marketing firm. Working for a few years helped me understand the perspective of the audience and I was one of the best at my job. One thing led to another. Now I could see respect in the eyes of my co-workers. My opinion mattered. I was taking big decisions for my company. Even Raj realized my potential. My life had changed. I was confident and ready, and my journey only empowered me and made me stronger. Never in my life had I felt so good.
As I sit here today in this raging traffic around me. I wait eagerly to start this new phase in my life. I wonder why women are expected to sacrifice so much for the well being of the family. I proved my father wrong. I proved the society wrong. Every drop makes an ocean, every girl can dream and change society just as I did. Here I am today being true to my name “Sapna”, I dreamt it and now I have achieved it.",kids
sir i am murderer ,"“Sir, I am a murderer.” She was trembling while saying this. She was sitting in our police station, opposite to my table. She was there to surrender herself. I was the in charge of the police station.

She was a beautiful lady of about 22 or 23 years, had long hairs which were maintained really nicely, wearing pink shirt and dark blue jeans, had sunglasses on her eyes. She was looking from a nice and rich family.

“Who did you killed?” Well I asked her after taking a long pause because her first sentence was not really expected or if I talk frankly, I was lost in her beauty.

“I have killed 3 people.” I was really surprised to hear that. A girl, so pretty, can kill 3 people and also committing it in front of police. The whole thing was a bit unusual for me.

“I have killed my Gardner, my driver and "" She paused a bit and started to sob. “And my mother.” She started crying hard. I gave her water and she started to take sip from that glass.

When she controlled her emotions, she continued to talk. “Please I beg of you, please arrest me otherwise I will kill someone else also.”

“Why did you kill them and why will you kill others? Mam What’s your name?”

“Shilpa.” She was still sobbing.

“Shilpa, why did you kill them?”

“I don’t know. I just happened automatically.”

“Shilpa, I am not getting it. And I cannot arrest you without any complaint and without seeing the body of the dead people you are talking about.” She was looking very tense to me. So I continued, “Shilpa, where are the bodies?”

“I dug them in my garden.” She was not looking like fake but what she was saying was even not looks to be believed.

I decided to go to her house. I took two constables also with me. When we reached her house she took us to her garden and told us the places where the body of the gardener and driver were dug. I commanded the constables to take the bodies out.

“Where’s the body of your mother?” I asked Shilpa.

“Inside the home.”

I started to follow Shilpa. She took me inside the house and then stopped in front of a dark room.

“Inside. My mother is lying inside.” She started to cry again.

I slowly started to move inside the room. The room was so dark that it was difficult to see anything. I had one torch with me so I decided to turn that on. I searched the whole room but the room was empty. Then I saw one room which was closed.

I opened that room. And got shocked to see that there were three bodies lying inside the room. Two men may be Shilpa’s gardener and driver and one old lady may be her mother. I was wondering why Shilpa told me that bodies are out there in garden.

“Ahhhhhh………” Someone stabbed me from behind. I turned around. I was shocked to see Shilpa standing with a knife in her right hand covered with blood of mine.

“Why?” I asked her in a trembling voice.

She came closer to me and stabbed in my stomach and said, “Because, it’s fun.”

I fell on ground and she took my gun and rushed outside. I heard two fires. She killed my constables also

I saw her last image standing in front of mirror, combing her hairs and singing song………….
",thriller
Train ride,"I know she can feel me looking at her. I try to suppress the shock that is contorting my face. She’s eight or ten people behind me in the line. I avert my eyes, barely, attempting to camouflage my snooping. Her greasy hair and splotchy pink skin burn in my peripheral. The oblivious baby on her hip. The royal blue spaghetti strap dress. Half-dress. I shiver.

She’s looking at me, it’s obvious. Disgust plastered on her face. Everyone is looking at me. Well, this is what he wanted. What he always wants. I’m used to the attention. A cool gust of wind shoots between my legs. I shiver.

Why is she wearing strappy heels at a carnival? On a January evening when the sun is threatening to disappear any minute now?

My husband gestures for me to move toward him. I shift Jacob over to my other side. He’s heavy, 15 months already. It’s a prison of sorts, motherhood. I definitely didn’t ask for this. I shake the thought and step toward my husband, who I didn’t ask for either. He doesn’t offer to take the baby, of course. I rub my sore, bony hip with my palm.

That poor baby. At least he’s wearing more clothes than his mom. A pang of guilt pulses in my chest. Why am I judging her like this? My daughter tugs at my jacket. “Mom, when will it be our turn?” I look at her, slightly annoyed that she’s pulled me away from my point of intrigue. “Soon,” I say. She hangs her head, unbelieving.

He pulls me in and kisses my forehead. He smells of cigarettes. Instinctively, I reach for my back pocket to check for a pack of smokes.  But pockets are nonexistent in this dress he picked for me. Good thing, I guess. I haven’t smoked in two years, since the day I found out I was pregnant. I smoked that day of course, from the disturbing shock of it all. But then, I quit. Except for two private, celebratory moments: the day after Jacob was born and one day six weeks ago when I bought today’s carnival tickets.  

I pretend to be enthralled by my daughter’s hair, brushing it with my fingers. But my gaze is pulled to the woman. She’s magnetic. Harsh cheekbones, strong chin, sinewy arms. But my guess is she’s stronger than she looks. I take in the man. Plump, balding, yellow skin. Warm in that checkered wool coat he has yet to offer his woman.

She’s still looking. I look right at her to intimidate, make her uncomfortable, force her to look away.

She catches my eyes. I hold my gaze a beat longer than I should, trying to communicate something to her. But what? That I see her? That I see her pain?

Her eyes flash with something before she looks away. Something more than pity. Empathy? Understanding? My stomach flips. Then, my husband squeezes my arm tight. Possessive. And rough, always too rough.

The line finally moves, and by a quick count of the seats, I can see we will be on the same train ride as the woman. My daughter and I take our seats first. My shoulders tense in anticipation of the woman walking right by me to sit behind us on the train. When she passes me, I keep my gaze down and fight the urge to graze her arms with my fingertips. It’s insane, this urge. I know it is. As if she would just stop. If only I could make her stop. I want to hear her story, from start to finish. Her feet click clack past me. There’s something in her stiletto, tucked under the sole of her foot. It looks like cash.  

I avoid looking at the woman as I pass her, tending to Jacob, asking if he’s excited to ride the train for the very first time. He babbles while I sit and shift him to my lap, settling into our seats three rows behind the nosy woman. My husband pulls me closer, inadvertently jamming the clip of his pocketknife into my bare outer thigh. I suck in a breath. I focus on the top of Jacob’s head, whose tiny, chunky body is warming my core.

As the train departs the faux station, a recorded narration begins, a booming voice sharing facts about the history of the carnival. I realize I won’t be able to overhear anything during the ride. No clues, no sense of how the woman is doing. Or the baby. What could happen, though? Too many pairs of eyes as witnesses. Menacing thoughts swirl as I try unsuccessfully to drown out the annoyingly chipper narrator. My daughter looks up at me and smiles. A lump suddenly and unexpectedly forms in my throat.

I feel trapped, and not just in this moment, in his forceful embrace. Always. Anger simmers inside me more lately. I used to numb it with alcohol. He doesn’t know I’ve quit drinking; I’m good at pretending. He thinks he couldn’t control me if I had my wits about me. And he’s right. If he only he knew how he’s being played. That my plan has been in motion for weeks.

I swallow my emotions and feign interest in the lights and sights all around me (as if I’ve never seen a Ferris wheel), but it’s only an excuse to turn my head. The woman is staring intently at something in the distance. I wonder—no, I crave to know what’s she’s thinking. Dark circles hover beneath her lower lashes like bruises. Or are they bruises? “Mom, can we get cotton candy after this?” My daughter’s voice startles me. “Yes, babe.” I force a smile and pat her hand. When I turn to look back, not even trying to hide it this time, the woman is looking right at me. I freeze.

You think I’m weak? You think I’m not in control? Just wait.

She tilts her head down ever so slightly and holds her gaze on me. Then, a confident, sinister smile creeps up one side of her mouth. My eyes widen and I face forward again. “Mom, the tunnel! Look!” My daughter tugs at my sleeve. “Yeah, babe, very cool. Get ready, it’s going to be dark.” She grabs my hand. I squeeze hers tight. We inch closer to the tunnel. The narrator drones on about how great everything is, how excited we should be, how old the tunnel is, an epic feat of engineering for the time it was built. I resist the urge to yell shut up. He’s distracting me. I’m trying to figure out what is wrong with this family. And what I can do to help. If I could just get her alone for two minutes…

We inch into the tunnel and slow to a complete stop. It’s pitch black, save for a red EXIT sign far in the distance. Kids squeal and giggle. Mine remains silent but squeezes my hand tighter. The narrator booms on and time seems to stand still. I count my breaths, which accelerate from the stress of not knowing when we will be free from this blackness, this excruciating ride…

A jolt. We’re moving again. Moments later we burst forth into freedom, the dusky sky above, the train station in sight just around the bend. I exhale. Then a scream. “Stop the train!” someone yells from behind me. “Stop the train!”

The recorded voice is cut off mid-sentence, then the train comes to a sudden halt. My daughter and I are thrown forward into the back of the seat in front of us. “Are you okay?” I ask her as I sit her back on the seat. “Yes.” Another scream. We both turn to look.

The man is there, head hung low, jaw slack. The woman and baby are gone.

Several adults jump from their seats to tend to the man. I can barely lift my daughter anymore, but adrenaline shoots through me as I jump out of my seat and pull her onto my hip in a split second. I run to the seat where the woman was, but I can’t get a good look through the half dozen bodies who beat me there. “There’s blood!” Someone yells. A few people jump back, clearing a space for me to see. Instinctively I cover my daughter’s eyes. If I were a better mother, I’d be a quarter mile away from here by now. But I must know.

Blood pools on the seat next to the man. It drips down onto the floor of the train, sprinkling dots of crimson onto a pair of perfectly upright stilettos. No cash in sight, I realize. His hand is clasped around something on his bulging hip. A brave young man unravels the man’s fingers. A knife.

He doesn’t appear to be breathing. Someone checks for a pulse. As a crowd descends on the train, I turn and take my daughter away. I walk briskly past the Ferris wheel, past the cotton candy vendors. She asks me questions about what happened, but her words meld together like molasses among the cacophony of carnival sounds. My arms burn with the weight of her, but I press on.

She’ll be on the fringes. Hiding in the dark. Becoming brand new. Then she will emerge unrecognizable. I know what I need to do. If questioned, I will protect her by forever denying the existence of a barefoot fugitive in a tiny blue dress. And it will be true. Because as of this moment, that woman no longer exists.",thriller
the last treasure,"On a barren mountainside glowing pink with sunrise, two fairies worried at the entrance of a rock-hewn tunnel that gaped hungry and silent.

“Go on, then,” urged the fairy dressed in ivy leaves. His silken wings scattered refracted light across the landing as he flitted back and forth, back and forth.

“Just give me a minute, yeah?” the other said, running damp palms down the petals of her iris tunic.

“You said yourself this hoard’s been abandoned. Nothing to be afraid of, right?”

“I know! I know it’s probably completely safe, I just…!” Iris paused and glanced at Ivy. “You go first.”

“This was your idea!”

“Ok, ok, fine! I’ll go, I’ll go, but if something happens to me, you’ll have to live with that guilt for the rest of your life.” The purple-clad fairy lifted her chin and straightened her wings, flew in a circle once, then disappeared into the tenebrous maw.

“Ohh,” Ivy moaned, then darted in after his friend.

Deep in the stomach of the of the mountain, on a bed of gold coins and precious gems, an ancient beast dreamed. Great armoured legs twitched; reptilian eyelids fluttered. Its sulfurous breath quickened as it met a grand crescendo that jolted it onto all fours, whipping its tail through the shadowed towers surrounding its nest.

The resounding clatter of tumbling metal seemed to adjust the beast to its waking world. It blinked around at the vast cavern, lit only by intermittent cracks in the mountain’s shell and overflowing with a millennium of hoarded treasure. Dampened, the dragon flicked a dull bronze urn at the foot of its nest and curled in on itself to savor the soft ping.

The stagnant air rippled almost imperceptibly, sending a tingling down the dragon’s scales.

“Ouch! Watch where you’re flying, you bumblebee!” a windchime voice cut through the darkness.

“Sorry, I can barely see anything! Ugh, it kind of stinks in here, doesn’t it?”

“Focus! It might take days or even weeks for us to search this whole place, so we have to be efficient.”

The silent shadow slowly unfurling in the center of the cavern was lost on the intruders.

“Any luck?”

“Not really. I think we should bring a fire bug next time so we can properly look around.”

“Would this make your search a little easier?” a deep voice growled, bright embers spilling from the serpentine face above the fairies’ heads.

“WAAAUUGGGHHHH!”

The dragon swept the fairies into a birdcage cloaked in sooty cobwebs and tossed it onto a pile, stirring up a cloud of ash that set them coughing and spluttering. An upturned vanity bloomed with flame from a fallen ember, illuminating the great beast in an ominous vacillating light.

“HOW DARE YOU ENTER THE LAIR OF LAVINIUM?”

The mountain shook with the gravity of Lavinium’s roar. The fairies clutched each other and trembled on the cage’s filthy floor.

“SPEAK!”

“W-w-we-we were l-l-looking f-fo-f-“ Ivy stumbled over his wooden tongue.

“For a p-powerful ancient relic of The Fae,” Iris continued bravely. She took a deep breath, choked down a cough, and squared her wobbly shoulders. “The Monarch Throne. It contains deep, old magic, and-”

“-And you thought to seek glory by recovering it for your people, I’m sure,” Lavinium sneered, dark tendrils of smoke curling from its nostrils. “It matters not. For intruding, you must face the consequences. I have no appetite for fairies, so a simple execution will suffice.”

“We’re not seeking glory!” Iris insisted. “We truly thought this hoard was abandoned, and we’re terribly, terribly sorry! It’s just- our people were so weakened by the humans’ raids, and now that they’re gone, we’re finally getting to rebuild. We’re only looking to recover what was taken from us! Please, do you- is the Monarch Throne here?”

“And why would you care to know if you are to die regardless?”

“Please!” Iris dropped to her knees to beg properly. “If you have it, please return it to the fairies, then you can come execute us all you want!”

“I don’t want to be executed!” Ivy whispered hoarsely.

Lavinium considered this. “…Yes, it is in my possession,” it finally said.

“Then-!”

“But I will not relinquish it.”

“Why not?!” Iris cried.

“Because it is mine,” the dragon said simply, yawning a fresh torrent of sparks over its hoard. “Principle, tradition… You are too young to understand such things.”

“I’m 142,” the fairy protested.

“And I have lived twenty of your lifetimes,” Lavinium thundered, looming imperiously over the cage. “Know this: a dragon is its hoard. The two are never separated, not even by death. Those who disturb my hoard shall be punished; so it is, so it shall always be.”

“Mm,” Ivy whimpered, his knees knocking together as he gripped Iris’s arm in an iron vice.

Desperation flared in Iris’s chest. “Wh-what if you were to add a new treasure to your hoard? To replace the Monarch Throne, and- and freshen up around here?”

“All the human ruins have been scavenged since their demise,” Lavinium brushed off. “There is nothing more to obtain.”

“Not human.” Ivy clenched her tiny fists and stiffened her resolve. “Elf treasure. The Evergreen elves have been hiding something away from the rest of the world. No one knows what it is, but from how they’ve been acting, I think it must be really special.”

A flame of infernal laughter erupted upwards. “Your ignorance is astounding. Only humans were worth plundering. Only humans deserved it. The greed and hubris that condemned them were the very things that created such magnificent treasure. And now that my old enemy is gone…”

Lavinium sank back onto its haunches. It reached out and stroked a rusting suit of armour, examined the grimy residue left on its talon. “No one ceaselessly hunting my treasure for riches, or my hide for glory. No one decrying me a monster and cursing God when I act the part. Those foolish, contradictory creatures with their obsessive suffering. In their absence… is peace.”

The fairies flinched at the punctuating clatter of Lavinium flicking a tarnished crown against the cavern wall. Lost in thought, it lumbered around the cavern, pawing through its hoard treasures and murmuring to itself.

“What are you thinking?!” Ivy hissed while the dragon was preoccupied.

“I think I’ve seen something like this before,” Iris whispered back.

“What?”

“Ivy, look around you! Dragons are supposed to have pride in their hoard, right? But this place is…” she trailed off.

For the first time since entering Lavinium’s lair, Ivy took in his surroundings. In the wavering light of the burning vanity, the so-called ‘treasure’ could at best be described as decrepit. Everything the light touched was covered in ash, rusting, rotting, or broken. He looked down and realized he was much the same; blackened with soot and sticky with spiderwebs, he and Iris looked as if they had been lost to the recesses of time in what was turning out to be more of a tomb than a treasure trove.

“It’s like when my cousin tore her wing and couldn’t fly anymore,” Iris went on. “Everything in her life went to seed. She was just… too empty to care anymore.”

“Comparing your crippled cousin to a dra-gon feels a little…”

“That’s obviously not the point, Ivy!”

“Ok, ok, but what does this have to do with the elves?”

Iris sighed. “How badly do we want the Monarch Throne?”

Ivy paused. “We’d do anything for it,” he said quietly.

“Yes.” Iris nodded with a smile that didn’t reach her eyes. “Yes, so please forgive me for trying.”

“Perhaps…” said Lavinium suddenly, returning to the present and its prisoners, “perhaps one last attempt at gaining a new treasure would do me well. The Evergreen elves…” A pause. “I never have cared for elvish beings. Such feeble peace-touters. If they really do have some treasure hidden away, as you say, then that makes them hypocrites, and I loathe hypocrisy.”

The fairies glanced at each other.

“Should I find something worthwhile, you may have your throne or your freedom. Not both. Use the time I am gone to make your decision, for I am not a patient being. If, however, this is a waste of time and energy…” The dragon’s lips curled and its throat ignited.

Ivy whimpered.

Without another word, Lavinium wove through the maze of junk and took off down the tunnel, leaving the fairies in a flickering silence.

“Oh, Iris…”

“I know, I know.” Iris’ head dropped into her hands as she sank to the cage floor. “I just… I know. But I had to. Our people need that magic… your father…”

Ivy bit his lip and frowned. A tear cut down his sooty cheek as he knelt next to his friend and laid his head on her shoulder.

After a moment, Iris rested her own head against his. “I wish you weren’t here, Ivy.”

“Mm, I also wish I wasn’t here.”

This tugged a quirk from the corner of Iris’s rose petal lips. “But… I’m also glad. After almost half a century, we finally found the Monarch Throne. Heh. Just imagine the look on old Oakie’s face when a dragon comes and drops off the throne.”

“Our names will go down in Fae History, probably.”

“I guess Lavinium was right about us seeking notoriety, then,” Iris said, stroking the soft down of Ivy’s hair.

“Do you think Lavinium would deliver a message for us?” Ivy asked. “To say goodbye?”

“…We can ask.” Iris winced as she failed to keep the doubt from her voice.

The two fairies huddled together as the vanity slowly burned itself out. They shared fond memories and expressed their regrets while the light dwindled, and when the fire finally died, they were enshrouded in the somber peace of knowing and accepting their fate.

The sound of enormous leathery wings beating air down the tunnel broke the stillness, and they gripped each other’s hands and held their chins high.

A ring of fire billowed out to the cavern walls, igniting inlaid sconces and bathing the cathedral of neglect in warm light. Lavinium wound through the freshly illuminated junk piles with light, almost dainty movements, before disappearing from the fairies’ line of sight. Faint sounds of rustling and rummaging were all that alerted them to the dragon’s vague location within the lair.

“Seems like it’s in a good mood,” Iris whispered, ignoring the confusing blend of guilt and hope that rose in her throat.

Ivy nodded agreement. “But I didn’t see the treasure, did you?”

Lavinium emerged from the depths of a mound with something small cradled in its palm. As it drew closer, Iris felt herself grow cold with despair.

“Oh, no…” Ivy breathed.

In Lavinium’s hand was a fairy-sized throne that held the memory of magnificence, but was now, along with everything else in the stony crypt, suffered from age and disuse. The once lustrous monarch butterfly wings were now tattered, veiny husks of dust, and the spell embroidered in golden flax silk was frayed beyond recognition.

“Fret not. Despite its appearance, there is still some magic in this item. Feel it for yourselves.” It set the throne down and unlocked the birdcage with a deft talon. “Now go, restore this to your people.”

Ivy’s eyes widened. “You-you’re letting us go?”

“Would you prefer to stay?”

The fairies flew out of the cage and grabbed the crumbling throne before Lavinium could change its mind. Warm strength raced through their arms, setting their tiny bodies aglow with long-forgotten magic.

“Oh!” Iris sighed softly. Shifting the throne to one hand, she bowed deeply in midair. “Thank you, thank you! We- all the Fae- are forever in your debt.”

“Indeed, you are,” Lavinium agreed. “And I will demand repayment. Soon, I imagine.”

The fairies gulped in unison.

“Um, p-pardon me, Your Fieriness,” Ivy squeaked, giving an awkward half bow as he spoke. “What- sorry, what was the treasure the elves had?”

Iris glanced at the tunnel, itching to flee but equally curious about whatever it was that had awoken Lavinium so thoroughly.

Lavinium’s mouth stretched open, revealing several rows of iron dagger teeth forged strong and sharp over the centuries. The fairies realized with horror that it was smiling.

“Come,” it said, turning away from them. “Witness the miracle.”

Hesitant, yet unable to stop themselves, the fairies followed the dragon to the heart of the lair. There, sleeping soundly upon Lavinium’s enormous gilt nest, was a small child wrapped in a blanket of woven pine needles.

Iris gasped as the child turned its head, revealing an undeniably rounded ear. “What? How…?!”

Ivy flew backwards a few paces. “No, no, no, no…” he muttered, shaking his head.

No longer paying the fairies any mind, the dragon stroked the infant with a gesture that could almost be described as reverent.

“All of this is your legacy, little one,” Lavinium cooed. “The elves would have tried to tame your wildness, but I have set you free.”

They turned and fled.

Red-rimmed eyes on the vermillion horizon, the two fairies worried at the exit of the rocky tunnel that regurgitated them into the evening air. The tired throne swayed softly between them.",thriller
empty barrack,"They came just before dawn, slinky and quiet like a shadow. Eberhart did not see them coming, had no idea, really, that anyone knew what he kept beneath his floorboards. They must have worked quickly, efficiently because everything was completely cleaned out before the sun cast its first rays into the house. Before he woke to feed his five chickens in the pen in his backyard, before his creaky muscles rose in the creaky old house to put the coffee on, to brush his teeth, before the morning paper came. 

It must have been hours before Eberhart discovered the nothingness that awaited him underneath where he slept. A devastating nothingness, his life’s collection completely disappeared right under his snoring nose. It continued to stay there, the blank canvas of the concrete room loud in its barrenness, not even an echo to fill the desolate space. 

The lonely room waited patiently for him as Eberhart went about his morning like usual. A rigid man pushing 60, his routine had gone unchanged for the last 50 or so years. See, he was structured even as a child. Wake up, get immediately out of bed – no time for lollygagging, no time for daydreaming, no time for snoozing, as his ex-military father would say. You could be dead in an hour, what are you doing wasting your time? 

The only daydreaming Eberhart had ever indulged in was from this elusive statement. How could he be dead in an hour? He imagined a meteor crashing into his house, straight from the sky, burning hot, just big enough to cover his bed and nothing else. Or perhaps a gunman would burst through his front door while his parents were gone out and, thinking that the valuables would be in the master bedroom, mistakenly enter his own and find him, a wide-eyed kid, there. Not wanting witnesses, the robber would have no choice but to shoot him dead. 

Then there were the accidents he thought of, all sorts of things that could go wrong. Anything from a simple tumble down the stairs to an accidental gas fire if he was using the stove. Or maybe his mother would put water on to boil and he would accidentally tip it over, melting his skin to the ground or melting his lips together so he could not open them in a scream. Possibly an overtired truck driver could end up on their suburban street, lose control of the wheel, and crash into the living room, trapping him between the front grill and the wall. Maybe his mother’s chandelier was not installed properly and it would break from the ceiling at just the moment he would walk underneath it, crushing his body into a pulp. 

These unlikely events took over more of his mind as he went about his life, turning into a sick obsession and preventing him from wanting to leave the house as he grew older. 

The sudden death of both his parents just shy of adulthood only increased this deathly fear of death even more. 

That is why he started stockpiling. As far as the city was concerned, the house that Peter had always lived in, his parents house, did not have a basement. 

See, his father had illegally carved out a room underneath where they lived in case of emergency, he said. Eberhart's father possessed the same irrational fear that he passed down to his son and was convinced at any moment that armageddon would happen, the end of the world would come crashing down, and he had to build a place for his family to hide. 

Unfortunately, he and his wife died just after the barrack was completed, and before it was stockpiled. Eberhart took it upon himself to finish the job; despite the contents being much different from what his father might have imagined it to be, he felt a twisted and misguided pride that his father would be proud of him. 

Eberhart reflected on this fact as he reached the bottom floor of the modest house, the only photo in the entire place staring at him at the bottom of the landing as he paused for just a moment to stare at his parents blank gazes, slippers silent against the white, carpeted stairs. 

It was the same brief moment he took every day to be nostalgic, nostalgic of a time when he actually talked to people other than strangers on the internet, the people in movies, and the occasional voice in his head. 

He was halfway through his routine now, reaching the door and opening it to find a child, no more than 13, crouching down in front of his doorstep and reaching for his beloved paper.

“Hey Ebbie, how’s it cracking?” the kid said, smiling a large, braces-filled grin, his voice cracking with the first signs of puberty. 

Eberhart only grumbled, snatched the paper, and slammed the door. He never said a word to the neighborhood kids, but they continued to tease him. Especially in the summer months, they loved to play ding-dong-ditch, throw eggs at his front door, and occasionally try to enter through the back. Mostly harmless pranks with the objective to get the cranky old man to speak. It never worked. 

On the other side of the white door and the white house the barely-teenager giggled to himself and ran off to join his friends. It wouldn’t be long now, he thought to himself, eager to share his appearance with the other kids. 

Meanwhile, Eberhart put a pot of water on to boil, then two pieces of bread in the toaster. With that prepared, he walked to the back of the house and out the door, the only door he ever exited from, and went to feed the chickens. 

They were extra rowdy today, he noted with discontempt, running around all wild for the grain and clucking incessantly. He prided himself on how well behaved they could usually be, a trait he believed he instilled in them – although this would not actually make sense, so one could imagine they were more likely a bit overfed and lazy. 

Sighing in annoyance at the display, he quickly grabbed the eggs they had laid and headed back inside, definitely not taking the time to pause at the bright sun, the first rays in weeks after wet, overcast weather. 

The water was boiling now, so he dropped the eggs in, and the kettle was whistling for his instant coffee. First sugar, (he used far too much), a scoop of coffee, then just a splash of unpasteurized, sour milk he got from the farm up the hill, delivered promptly every Friday. He poured the water in and then waited patiently for it to cool, staring at the eggs for the entirety of the six and a half minutes it took to get them the perfect amount of runniness. 

With his toast perfectly burnt to a blackened crisp, he took his meager meal over to the latch in the back room that always stood open. 

Perhaps he had a feeling that something was wrong, that someone had maybe been there at this point, or maybe it was the excitement that came with an addiction, for Eberhart felt his breath quicken and his heart beat a little faster as he approached the stairs. 

These ones were not carpeted, they were cement and cool, and the blackness of the cold air underneath prickled at his skin before he even took the first step. 

One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven. Eleven skinny steps and he was at the lightswitch, flicking on with an air of someone who has done this thousands of times, perhaps millions, day after day for decades he took this journey. There was no pause this time, nothing out of the ordinary from the other times he had done this. 

Until the light was on. 

His body registered first what his eyes did not register, a wave of nausea taking over as he grew faint with fear and confusion. Eberhart leaned forward, but there was nothing to lean on but an empty shelf. Dozens of them, in fact, lining the walls of the bare concrete room, empty and devoid of even dust. 

The wooden shelf almost did not support his weight with nothing on it to secure it in place, and he stumbled again at the surprise of how flimsy the wood seemed to be. 

Blackness took over, his eyes no longer registering the emptiness of the room, but his mind could not forget – he became clouded in rage and let out a blood curdling, croaking, gurgling scream from scarcely used vocal chords. 

He was still screaming as his body thumped to the ground. 

Across the street a group of neighborhood kids, the one with the mouth full of braces included, huddled around a tiny television in the shed of one of their parent’s houses. It was silent except from screams and moans from the meager speaker, stacks of DVDs piled around the place, more trash bags of them waiting in the corner. 

“Where did he get this stuff?” One kid broke the silence, but not breaking the attention of the adolescent boys, wide-eyed, staring attentively at the first pair of tits any of them had ever seen, bouncing, grainy and rhythmically across the screen. ",thriller
death of an inner child,"People spend most of their days worried about the future, about whether they are truly living. I believe that is nothing but past thought, something that isn’t necessary for a man like me. 

The timed ticks of the office clock warned the workers of the deadline. It was crawling closer as we had to ready the documents before the main boss came in. Terrifying it was, but not for me, as I had everything set; it was something I trained for. I had steadily made rows of information on documents day in and day out for this moment, and it was almost done. Just after a few more days of work it will be done. 

“Turner.” I spun around to see one of my coworkers leaning on my office walls. 

“Get off.” I shooed their arm. 

“Okay Mr. Corner Office,” they said sarcastically, “Would you like to get a drink with me?”  

I barked out a laugh. “A drink at this hour? Only a fool would do such a thing!”  

“Ouch,” they shifted, “Can I at least walk you to the bus?”  

They seemed quite uncomfortable with the whole ordeal. “Just go home, I will be fine by myself.” I spun back to face my desk without another thought. 

“Oh. Okay then,” I heard them turn away, “Be safe.”  

I chuckled at the thought of having to do something so unprofessional. How ridiculous, Friday at 6:45 should be lean cuisine with a basic show. 

The document was saved as I closed the computer. I looked at my desk and nudged my mouse a few centimeters to the left as it was throwing off the whole look. A sigh of contempt left me as I reached for my dark leather bag and exited the office.  

The streets scurried with irrelevant people doing untimely things like always. It was the norm in this basic town, the basic town of black roads, different gray buildings, white skies, and varying townspeople.  

An unsightly thing clashed against the regular as it stood against the light gray buildings. A billboard having tints of color, how absurd! As much as it was an eyesore the statement drew some eyes in.  

Be the person younger you would like to be around. 

I scoffed at the words, but something in it seemed intriguing. My attention was pulled away as my bus rolled along the curb. With a screeching halt the doors hissed opened, and I walked to my regular second row seat. I pulled up my phone and scrolled though the news as the world zoomed past me.  

It was the same old things about this troubling world, no surprise there. I continued scrolling but then a forceful brake flung me into the seat in front of me. I barely caught myself as I watched a messy boy stumble into the bus.  

“Of course, a drunk.” I scowled and straightened my jacket.  

I went back to my phone but the feeling of someone staring at me forced me to look up.  

“Can I sit here?” The drunk held a bag of something and was clearly not in the middle class. 

“N-” The bus started suddenly making the boy fall into me.  

He chuckled. “I guess that’s a yes.” He sat upright in the aisle seat. 

I shifted closer to the window and looked around to see every seat covered. A little concerning as I remember the bus being deserted. I sighed and went back to my phone. 


“Do you mind?” I glared at the boy who was leaning over me.  

He flicked a fleeing strand of hair back, “I don’t however news nowadays are always so bad.”  

I pushed him off and straightened my jacket, “It’s always been bad.” 

The bus screeched to a stop as I grabbed my bag. I shooed the boy out of the seat and made my way out of the bus. I started my beeline straight to my apartment when a voice of apologetic bumbles followed me. I turned to confront him, but it was cut short as the sight was confusing. 

“Why thank you good sir,” An old woman took the bag from the boy with gratitude.  

“Of course! I wouldn’t like to see these flowers hungry.” The boy brushed some petals of a bouquet. He looked back at me then at the old woman, “I should get going, see you later Miss.” He waved at her while trotting towards me. 

“Let’s go.” The boy continued an enthusiastic stride into the gray apartment building. 

I followed suit, but it was intriguing how the lobby, elevator, and halls became tinted as he walked past; irritating but intriguing. So intriguing I didn’t even know he led me to my apartment. How in the 5 stars did he know where to go!? 

He planted his feet just to the side of my door and hopped to face me, like he knew that this was mine. His eyes watched me intently as I faced the door and fiddled with the keys. It had the same metallic and black keys but paired with a slightly brown door and tacky carpet. 

The door swung open to reveal my basic but well organized livings. Not a confusing color in sight, just how it should be.  

The boy hesitated before shutting the door behind him. He slowly walked around the area, observing every little thing. I saw as the area around him stayed normal shades of gray; interesting it was.  

“May I know who you are.” I hung my jacket in the closet and met him in the living room. 

The boy spun around a little dazed, “Oh yes! I am Keith Turner a florist from down the street.” He held out his hand with a wide smile painted along his face. 

I stared at him, “Keith Turner, credit analyst on 4th floor.” His hand found mine and gave it a firm shake. 

“Interesting that we have the same name, we seem like total opposites!” He laughed. 

“Yes, interesting it is.” I paused. “So, are you going to go to your place or?”  

“That’s the funny thing…. I kinda don’t have a place.” 

“What do you mean you don’t have a place?”  

“I once had a place, but I was sortaaa kicked out…” Keith rocked back on his heels. 

I sighed as my hand brushed through my slicked hair. “Well you should go down to the flower shop and ask to stay there.”  

“I could but Mrs. Goodman has already done so much, so what if I stay here?”  

“No.” 

Keith looked back at me, “C’mon pleaseee, us Keiths have to stick together.” He pleaded. 

I looked him dead in the eye like he wasn’t already a nuisance by screwing up my night. He slightly retreated but held his ground. 

I sighed, “Fine,” I threw my arms up and walked to the kitchen, “Just don’t ruin anything or I will throw you out.” 

“I will try my best!” I couldn’t see him, but I knew he was smiling. 

I rolled my eyes and grabbed two frozen meals. I placed one on the counter and heated up the other; switching them when one was done. When the microwave was quiet I realized that everything was quiet, which would’ve been nice if I was alone. I got some forks and walked over to the living room where Keith was huddled in the corner like a dragon protecting their hoard. 

“Keith?” I placed the dinners on the side tables. 

“You still like this?” He turned around with a little sun-activated dancing flower in his hands. 

Heat climbed up to my face as my words choked up. “No, I- this- that is not-” I inhaled, “No I don’t, it was a gift from my niece.”  

“Well, she has great taste.” Keith put the flower back on the windowsill and joined me on the couch. 

“Mhm.” I grabbed the remote and turned on an old soap opera about a detective and his daughter. 

“What is this?” I looked over at Keith who was poking his dinner. 

“Lean Cuisine.” 

“Where’s the good food?” 

“Cost too much.” 

“You make like 60 to 70 thousand a year!” 

“If you know that then you should know how much things cost; I have to make this stuff last.” I faced the tv again. Keith mumbled something but I didn’t care enough to pay attention. 

The show hit a monologue moment that piqued my interest. 

“Well you see, what tends to be a trend in these cases is that it is always due to a motive. The motive will not change no matter what, can you guess what the motive is? No? Well it’s the inability to let go, the inability to let go holds a lot of us captive even if we don’t know it, and those who do know try to do something. Some of those things may be self-improvement or murder. Now you might be asking what I might be unable to let go, well it could be current lifestyle, people, the past, or technically anything. It’s quite common, but just don’t kill anyone over it, or do, it let’s me keep my job.” 

I scoffed, these things do affect everyone, everyone but me. I got up from the couch and took our trash away. I caught a glance at the clock and felt satisfied it said 7:45, a little later than usual but still on time. Surprising it was still on time knowing the events that happened today. 

I walked by Keith as I headed to the bedroom, he seemed in another daze and didn’t even notice I was by him. I tapped his shoulder making him jump and spin to look at me. His fearful expression soothed as he realized it was me. 

“Do you have anything to sleep in?” I went to the small closet to grab some old blankets. 

“Nah, I’ll be alright.” He took the blankets with gratitude. 

“Well bathrooms over there, and there’s water in the fridge if you need it.” I pivoted around and started to my bedroom. 

“Thank you.” Keith’s voice was quieter. 

“Don’t mention it.” I shut my door behind me. 

The dark room was illuminated by the light gray moonlight making the scene eerie in a beautiful way. Maybe it was the way the town’s lights don’t reach the window or how everything was just a perfect shade away from one another making everything visible and clear. Such a beauty not many people can understand. 

I straightened my pajamas and collapsed in my bed as exhaustion overtook me. The covers swallowed me whole in a big hug, it was warm and soft, and familiar, but I don’t know where from. It doesn’t matter anyway. 



The light rays of the sun cooked my bed making it impossible to sleep. I groggily sat up and reached for my phone, a little curious why the alarm didn’t go off.  

6:45 

My eyes widened and I jumped out of bed, quickly getting dressed, I busted into the living room. Keith was still dead asleep, which didn’t matter. I made some toast for both of us and cleaned myself up while it was cooking. This wasn’t my routine, but I must make up for some lost time. 

I put Keith’s toast on a plate and held mine as I continued to grab my stuff. I walked into the living room where Keith was just barely waking up.  

“Mmmorning…” He grumbled.  

“Not right now, I’m late.” I swung my leather bag over my shoulders. “Toast is on the counter. Don’t touch anything other than the tv.” 

“K.” 

I shut my door behind me, and hurried to the bus stop, if I’m lucky enough my bus would still be there. I shuddered against the crisp morning air, the thought of having to go onto the 7:30 bus is petrifying as I would devastatingly late for the first time. I stopped at the bus stop and saw my bus leaving. 

“No, no no, dang it!” I frantically looked around for something, anything, to get me to work. 

Taxis, too expensive.

Subway, too expensive. 

I scowled as my gaze landed on the flower shop. Evaluating my options there’s no choice. I begrudgingly walked to Mrs. Goodman who was dusting the register. She saw me and immediately perked up like a puppy, an old puppy.  

“Oh Keith! There you are!” She hobbled over and hugged me. “It’s been so long.” 

“Ah yes…” I pulled away and brushed off my jacket. “Sorry to bother you, but I need something to get to work.”  

“How far away is it?” She tucked her duster away and wobbled to the back. 

“To 4th floor, it’ll be an hour at best.” 

She froze and turned to face me. “Now what are you doing working for those hobgoblins? They take and take and take without a second thought. You see your sister told you about that complex so you could work a favorable job not a soul draining one.” 

The mention of my sister hurt something inside me, but I buried it down. “I appreciate your concern but it pays well and I just have to finish the documents for the main boss.” 

“Enough nonsense Keith, follow me I have better work for you.” Mrs. Goodman took my hand and led me to a corner of the store where it was just stacked with plants. “Now tell me what is wrong with this flower.” She pointed at this gray looking rose. 

“It’s gray?” I guessed. 

“Gray? Oh, heavens no!” She touched the petals with such delicacy. “It’s rough and brittle, caused by too little hydration. Now, what do we do to fix that?” 

“Give it water?” She wacked my head with the duster. 

“C’mon now that’ll kill it! We need to give it a special blend of nutrients that’s mixed with light water.” She looked at me with sincerity, “What happened boy? When you first came here you loved my shop and you kept telling me off for ridiculous things.” 

“That boy was a fool that had no sense in moneymaking.” I looked down at her. 

“Is money all that is on your mind!” Worrying about that won’t fix anything! For heaven’s sake, you work at 4th floor and still live in an apartment!” 

“I’m aware of my living situation Mrs. Goodman.” I turned for the door, “It was an untimely mistake coming here.” I walked through the store of my childhood wishes but it was now gray and brittle like that sad rose.  

When I made my way to the bus stop, I called my boss telling him I would be extremely late. I sighed and sat down on the bench, something inside me was hurting but I buried it under my responsibilities. 

My phone buzzed in my pocket, I picked it up and answered. 

“Hello?” 

“Keith!” 

“Yeah?” 

“I heard you won’t be in today, why’s that?” 

“I missed my bus and I have to wait for the next one.” 

“How long will that be?” 

“A little more than an hour minutes.” 

“AN HOUR!?” 

I pulled the phone away from my ear. 

“Yeah, I live far away. 

“This can’t do. I’ll be coming to pick you up. What’s your address?” 

“You don’t have to.” 

“The boss is coming in today! I must!” 

“Why in the 5 stars is he coming in today!?” 

“I have no idea, everyone’s freaking out and we know you have the things to help us.” 

“I’ve sent you my address, hurry.” 

“Alright.” 

I put my phone away and looked around to try to ease my nerves. My eyes caught sight of that eyesore of a billboard.  

Let it go.  

What the hell? I’ve never seen a billboard change that fast before. It’s almost like it’s talking to me. My attention was pulled away by the squealing of brakes, a cop car pulled in front of me. I opened the door to see my coworker, he was out of breath. 

“How did you get here so fast?” 

“Cop car, lights, dad, get in.” He breathed. 

I hopped in and buckled my seatbelt. He didn’t waste a moment as he turned on the sirens and booked it. I tried to scream but my voice got caught in my throat, all I could do was look out the window. The same billboard kept popping up. 

Let it go, Keith. 

Please. 

Please don’t do this. 

Don’t let me go. 

I shut my eyes and opened them to the 4th floor building. My coworker and I bolted up the stairs to our office where the meeting was being held. Everyone looked at us as we approached my desk. I opened the laptop and pulled up the documents. 

My heart dropped.  

The words, all my hard work was destroyed. I frantically took a thumb drive I had saved and put it in the laptop. Everything was back. I sighed and spun back to face the circle around my walls. 

“Alright we need to fill in the rest of these with billings, spendings, taxes, and everything under the moon. Most of it is done, I’ll send each of you a copy for you to finish, follow my work and it will be done in a timely manner.” 

I spun back around to my desk and started the sharing process as the circle dissolved. I made sure everyone had something to do. I sighed and leaned back in my chair. 

“Keith.” 

 I spun around to see my coworker who helped me get here. “Yeah?”  

They fell into me with a hug. I stiffened as I realized their clothes had color. I patted their shoulder as they got off. 

“Thank you for getting me here.” 

“Anything for you Mr. Corner office.” 

Something dinged on my computer and just like that everything drained. The color that once was on my coworker was now a dull gray, and one phrase made it that way. 

Goodbye Keith. ",thriller
to kill or not,"Revenge – the action of hurting or harming someone in return for an injury or wrong suffered at their hands

Revenge at its finest is meant to be pure. It’s meant to be something beautiful and peaceful. Revenge is the act of you undoing something that has been done. It’s the act of you finding closure and finally coming to peace with terms. Revenge was never meant to be this boastful thing of getting an upper hand on someone. It was merely you finding peace with the situation. Truth be told how can I just let a murderer go unpunished? when everything in my existence arches because of him. I need to find peace; I need to get closure.

I was five when it all happened. The death of my family, my parents, siblings. The Dukes left me so I could tell their story. They left me so that someone could have bear witnessed to the horror they caused. They left me so that through me my family’s name and the horror tied to it would remain forever. I was a kid, traumatised, I saw blood drench out of five different bodies at the same time. I saw my mother die slowly, saw each breath pass, I saw her become a ghost. They thought I was the weakest. They thought I would let it go and be scared of them. I guess my existence was pre written as the slayer of the Dukes. Everyone is scared of them. They only thing I feared was loss. I already experienced it. I have nothing left in me to fear.

The Dukes are a secret organisation formed to create and inflame terrorism. It was an organisation formed by the darkest minds to do the darkest things. My parents made an organisation to tackle the Dukes. They were able to stop a lot of terrorism. However, once my parents were found out, the Dukes sought to slay them and make them an example for anyone who would dare think to oppose them. They have three heads at the table and have thousands of followers. Its weird how people are easily convinced to do evil. I guess I now understand why they say we are all born sinners. Evil is the closest thing to us hence the easiest to fall to.

The Dukes have people everywhere and anywhere. This means I don’t know who to trust. The world is in chaos now. Everything is different, everyone is scared. “What will be of tomorrow?” We all ask ourselves. We might wake up with a new leader, new government or even to death. The Dukes care little of life and are willing to sacrifice anything and anyone to get where they want to go. Killing them will be hard but when as something well while ever been easy?

I sharpen my knife and look at my reflection. I look at every scar caused by them. Both inward and out. They left me alive but they left a hole in and on me so that every time I look at myself or anyone looks at me they see the horror of the Dukes. I used to shy away because of it, now I own it and I promised myself this scar will be the last thing the Dukes ever see. I take my knife and gun. The gun is more for the pawns, the Dukes however, I want to take my time and pry each breath, each drop of blood and make my own scars on them. There are going to know who I am and when the Grim Ripper asks what happened the Dukes will call me death.

The hardest part of this is knowing who to trust. The world has changed and I need allies. No one can take down an entire army on their own, not even vengeance. I needed a team and with no family that was going to be the hardest thing ever. I had no friends, no relatives to count on, I was a ghost living a human experience. I was alone. I looked at my knife and saw it glare back at me. Was I going to let fear seduce me into forgiveness, seduce me into letting this all go? What would my parents think of me? It’s not that I was afraid of going after them. I feared not being able to put down the bane of my existence. “This will be the day I die” kept playing in my head. I was about to have the most glorious and dignified death. I was going to eliminate the Dukes and unlike them I wouldn't leave any child, any wife or any servant to take up their revenge. I was going to learn from their mistakes and clean the entire blood line.

My parents left documents on the origins and location of the Dukes. That’s all I had to find them. The worst part was I didn’t know whether they would still be located there. I wish my parents were still here. They would probably know what to do. I took a leap of faith, I just had to. I went to the dorks located outside of town. I wore my black skin suit and a mask. I didn’t want them to know who was coming just yet. It had to be a surprise, that the little girl they left scarred was back, and she was out for blood.

I slowly walked past the gate and my senses were on high alert. I didn’t know what to expect and needed to be ready for literally anything. I took my gun out and slowly paced to the door in front of me. I listened in to see if there was anyone on the other side. I breathed in, took off my mask and then boom! I busted the door open. As I got in my entire being was shock. There were men and women surrounded at a table. They all turned and looked at me. Their faces were covered up. I didn’t know what to do. There were bodies on the floor. They were corpses. And yet they were so comfortable as though it were any other day. I felt a presence behind me and I turned and shot it. It fell to the ground and as the figure was dying it whispered a name. Part of me hoped it was mine, maybe then I would have truly avenged my parents. I quickly turned back to make sure no one else was trying to kill me. The figures just sat there, they sat studying me. It was as though I was a ghost they just couldn’t figure out. I guess they were stalling because back up arrived immediately. I was out numbered and out gunned. I didn’t want to give in. I was willing to die and maybe finally be with my parents. They all didn’t make a move towards me, all twenty-five guards just stood there looking at me.

The largest figure stood up and made its way towards me. I pointed my gun at it. This wasn’t about them feeling pain anymore. Now I just wanted them gone. As it came closer I tried pulling the trigger and the figure uttered my name. “Gracie!” 

“How do you know my name?”

“I know the name of every individual I let live. It would be cruel not to, don’t you think”

“Isn't the cruelty in killing?"" 

""I doubt. Especially if you are dying for the right cause. I would honestly see it as admirable. Look at all those bodies on the ground, each body died for something it believed in. I wouldn't call it cruelty more like desirable, because their lives won't be in vain.""

""You talk of vain and yet they have loved ones who won't see them again. Desirable yet none of them truly knew what they were getting into"" 

""This is about your parents Grace. I know. It was hard on me too. I mourned for them."" 

""Why would a monster like you mourn?""

""The same reason you would...Grace. Because they died. Maybe your won't fully understand but I do have a heart."" 

I don't know what happened the bullet just left my pistol. The figure went on one knee, it went on both knees and finally fell to the ground. I took my knife out as the guards surrounded ready to fire. I looked him dead in the eye and ran my blade across his face. 

""Now you are going to feel the same pain I did.""

I could smell the blood I was about to make ooze out of him. I was about to insert the knife in him when he told me to remove his mask and everything would make sense. It was a dying man's wish I had to honour it. The real decision was whether to honour if while he was still breathing or not.

I took off the mask and the horror waiting underneath was worse than that I thought happened all those years back. The murderer, the Dukes, they weren't just the bane of my existence. They were part of it. There's nothing worse than truly knowing that even in family you can't trust any one. As I held my uncle in my arms with a knife about to pierce his chest. I saw flashes of my mother, of father and of my siblings. Was I about to turn into a monster as well. What I was about to do next would define me for the rest of my life. 

I looked at my uncle with rage and fury. I couldn't let this go. He killed my parents. He needed to pay! And he did. More peaceful than I wanted him to. I just left him. I didn't want to be like him. Me finishing off the job after knowing who he was, I couldn't do it. I stared down at everyone else as I was leaving and they knew revenge and been done.

Did I forgive them? No! I just didn't want anymore family members dying in one day. I want each one to suffer their own fate. Now since I know who they are, it's much easier.

The old igloo ammo bunker built during World War Two was now a personal storage warehouse, sold off like the others in the area when the government no longer needed the infrastructure. 

Located in the middle of nowhere, Hamilton Township, Illinois, the place felt like a forgotten ruin. A simple chain link fence with a small access hut next to the gate separated the gravel lot outside the large steel doors from the surrounding farmland. An early autumn breeze disturbed the corn in the field surrounding this bunker as dark gray clouds of a ponderous cold front rolled closer. 

Adam’s musing was interrupted by a sharp whistle as the team lead walked away from the lawyer with a set of keys. Rick, a brick of a man, was the oldest member of the group. He headed for the door giving the other three a quick set of directions.

Adam was enjoying the summer job so far. It was good pay for decent work and the crew he was with were decent fellas. Thanks to them and the job he had been able to save up enough for his last two semesters at trade school. In fact, after this job he’d be able to pay off several loans with plenty to spare.

Adam exchanged a few jokes with the other two crew members, Lawrence and Mike, while grabbing equipment and tools from the truck. They caught up to Rick as he opened the main doors. 

“So,” belted Rick, “we have two weeks to complete the job with a twenty-five percent bonus on the line.” He waved his hand toward the suited figure, “Mr. Janiski will accompany us inside to make sure we have full access.” The lawyer representing the new owner of the warehouse gave a curt nod and smile. Then the group moved into the bunker. 

The immediate inside was smaller than the original blueprints depicted. A newer cement wall erected in the rear cut the original area in half. A simple lift elevator in the far-left corner floor was another addition and the only other feature besides a simple wooden desk, chair, and metal filing cabinet to the right of the entrance. 

Rick flipped an old lever switch and electrical components and light fixtures hummed to life. The fixtures were old, but the electrical wiring, bulbs, and breaker boxes looked modernized at least. 

“Well, should be an easy job,” joked Lawrence, nodding at the three items in the space. 

Janiski cleared his throat, “Let’s check the lift first, to be sure you can meet the deadline. My client, mister M. T. Modle, was very adamant.”

The group moved to the lift and descended. The doors opened but nobody moved. Beyond the doors were piles, clusters, and rows of milky white plaster mannequins. More than could be counted. All with blank, featureless faces, staring back at the group. 

“Oh my God…” whispered Janiski.

“Well, now we know why the pay was so nice,” Mike chuckled uneasily.

Adam shuddered.


They got a late start the next morning. All of them had a rough night but Lawrence never showed up, not at breakfast or at the truck at the agreed time. They tried checking his room, but no one answered, and they couldn’t find any staff to assist. Rick, exasperated, finally decided to get going and would come back during the lunch break to check on him. 

Half an hour later they were pulling up to the bunker. The trio went inside and opened the cage again. Mike was talking with Rick about Lawrence and timelines as Adam started loading figures into a bin. He gave one in a stack a solid tug and jumped back as the mountain of dummies flowed towards him, crashing into the ground.

“You gotta be kidding me!” cried Mike.

Adam turned, ready to apologize, and stopped when he saw Mike wasn’t addressing him. Obscured by the models and now visible was another ornate, metal door with a giant padlock containing three separate keyholes on the hinge.  

“Okay, okay,” Rick ran a hand through his hair, “Adam, keep hauling these out. Mike, you and I will check out what’s on the other side. We’ll be back in twenty minutes tops.”

Adam nodded and took a second to pop out some ear buds and turn on some music. He opened the music app and started a heavy metal instrumental playlist, then got to work.

He lost himself in the deep base of the music and the repetition of the work until he stopped for a quick coffee break, realizing only when he checked his phone, that two hours had passed. Adam took out his ear buds and the silence of the bunker was almost deafening. Like standing in a tomb.  

The lift gears shrieked, and he turned sharply towards the ascending lift, swallowing his heart back into his chest and breathing a sigh of relief when someone above called out. Adam responded and met another man wearing coveralls with the waste management company’s logo they contracted for the job here at the base of the lift.  

 “Wow, creepy central down here,” the man, Diego, said looking from the figures to Adam, “anyway, just looking to get a signature for the second dumpster.”

“Sure thing,” Adam said taking a clipboard and pen. The hairs on his neck rose as a shiver went down his spine. “Hey, you didn’t see two other fellas up there, did you?”

“Wouldn’t be here if I did.”

The sound of heavy doors slamming shut echoed through the chamber.

“Something I should know,” Diego asked aloud.  

Adam’s reply stuck in his drying throat as a cracking, scraping sound echoed down to them and the lights dimmed. Adam grabbed a crowbar and one of the portable work lights before the darkness enveloped them. More cracking and grinding noises rose up out of the dark, stopping when Diego turned on a pocket flashlight.  

“So, I’m guess–” Diego never finished his thought. As he talked, he turned about with the light, illuminating one of the mannequins that had materialized next to him. He yelled and dropped the light in surprise, stumbling away into the shadows. The beam of light danced about, and Adam saw more figures appear where they had not been before, poses changing between moments of illumination. Adam franticly searched the unfamiliar light for the on switch shuffling backward from the hair-raising sounds, swinging the crowbar wildly. In the three seconds it took for Diego to drop the light, fall out of view, and Adam to finally turn on the high-powered lamp, hundreds of mannequins had entered the chamber. Some struck strange poses as if in the middle of a dance routine while others simply stood erect, looking at Diego or Adam.  

Diego lay on the ground panting, surrounding him was a circle of ten figures all looking down at him, one with blood covered fingertips. He yelled the longest utterance of expletives Adam had ever heard then barreled through the circle, toppling three models, scooped up his light and ran over to the section of wall by Adam. He checked the wound along his neck – blood trickled down to his collar, but the slices were shallow, and the blood was already slowing. They stared wide-eyed at the room before them.  

“Don’t”, Diego swallowed, “Don’t turn off the light.”

Adam nodded hard, holding the lamp out like a shield. Nothing moved for the moment. 

“Can we get out with the lift?” whispered Diego.

“No,” Adam muttered back, “no power no lift, but the original plans had tunnels linking the bunkers together with surface access.”

Adam swallowed hard, “We just need to go in there,” and nodded towards the strange door in the cage.

They looked at the door, then each other, the strange reality giving way to grim understanding. The two men steadied themselves and moved side by side, Diego covering any shadows with his flashlight, towards the inner door.  

They pushed past the door as Adam slammed it closed. He turned to keep going and nearly bowled over Diego. The two had moved from one hell to another. The area seemed to be endless, filled with shelving units and stacked crates that sectioned off rooms. In the first two rooms to the left and right were more mannequins, more than made any sense. Most stood against the walls, but some were posed and arranged as if performing a scene of some sort.  

Adam’s skin crawled as a scratching noise reverberated from the door at his back. Both agreed they should start moving for an exit. Adam felt watched in the oppressive darkness – cracking and grinding ringing out intermittently from beyond the edge of their light.  

They moved slowly. One room they passed look as if the models were holding mass, one standing at a podium of broken mannequin parts with its arms stretched upwards.

The next depicted a tug of war, one of the mannequins in place of a rope.

They moved further along the rooms when Diego excitedly muttered, he saw an exit sign. That was when they came to a room with many models sitting at a table, as if in the middle of a feast. The table was littered with mannequin limbs. No, they were yellowish. 

Adam squinted against the darkness.

“Bones,” breathed Diego, turning his light back towards the exit.

The lamp light flickered for half a heartbeat. When it steadied cold fear griped Adam like never before in his life. He could barely think. A wall of mannequins had moved within feet of them from the way they came, standing in rows as far as Diego’s light could reach. The ones from the dining room had crammed into the room entrance, striking poses of mock interest, many holding clawed hands to their smooth chins, or where the mouth should have been. One held a femur inches from Adam, parallel to his, as if measuring him.

The duo moved a little quicker along the path, desperation etching into Diego’s brow. Adam prayed relentlessly, hoping they weren’t walking into a trap.  

Rooms passed, depicted scenes growing in obscenity, when the aisle turned sharply. Behind the corner a dark red jacket emerged from the shadows. He recognized the sleeve; it was Rick’s jacket.

“Rick!” cried Adam.

“Quiet!” Diego hissed.

Adam ignored him and quickened his pace to the turn, then froze. Diego swore under his breath and pulled Adam along again. The jacket was Rick’s. It was about all of Rick that was there too. The Jacket wrapped around a bloodied, skinless torso – no arms, no head – strings of dark meat and entrails hanging out where the waist should have been, pinned to the wall with a mannequin arm. 

Adam resisted Diego’s pull long enough to grab a set of keys.

The isle turned towards the exit again. It was close enough for each red fluorescent letter to stand out. The lamp flickered and dimmed. Diego broke into a sprint, Adam pounding hard behind him. The sounds of unnatural entities moving with them increased with every step.

They were so close. So close. Adam shook the lamp as if his willpower alone could keep it charged.  

The far wall at last materialized on the edge of the light just as the lamp dimmed once more and Something grabbed Adam’s ankle. He stumbled, sprawling against a shelving unit with wooden crates. Diego exhaled as if hit by something heavy.  

The corridor erupted into chaos as Diego’s light created a strobe effect spinning on the ground. Diego screamed and Adam began sobbing as he crawled. He felt the back of his collar, lifting him up, and swung the crowbar he forgot he had out of reflex. The crowbar connected with something, and he was free, only to be grabbed by the arm and tossed headlong towards the exit wall.  

He hit the ground headfirst, stars swimming in his eyes.  

Sickening pops and snaps filled his ears followed by Diego shrieking in pain and fear. Adam felt more than heard or saw something moving closer and he drove the crowbar at it, hitting something, and receiving a breathtaking slam into his chest over his heart. He went flying again.

Adam rolled over in pain, saw the flashlight inches from his head, grabbed it and illuminated the hallway, holding the tool like a firearm. 

He was in the corner near the exit door. A model was crouched like a tiger about to pounce in front of him, a hole pierced in its chest. Another reached out for his throat, talon like digits inches away.

The wall of mannequins was back. Just in front of them a white figure lay flat on the ground, its head shattered to the neck. A model knelt next to the fallen one, it’s hand over its face as if mourning. A second mannequin kneeled holding the fallen’s hand, looking in Adam’s direction.  

Adam looked over at Diego. He laid on the ground, looking up into the darkness, one arm resting at an odd angle. A figure squatted; its hands buried into Diego’s abdomen, pinning him. A mannequin held one of his legs, torn away at the hip, over its head like a trophy. Diego gasped as a pool of blood spread under him.

Adam sobbed as he watched the man’s breath slow then stop. He looked at each frozen figurine, menace thickening the air. Finally willing himself to move, Adam grabbed the crowbar first, then the keys, and slowly slid up the wall.  

A sharp pain in his chest almost doubled him over. He pulled out the ruined remains of his phone from his chest pocket, probably the only reason he was alive, and tossed it to the ground. Every breath was a Herculean task now. But the need to keep the light level drove him like a gazelle fleeing from a lion. He fumbled the keys into the lock, finally finding the right one on the fifth attempt. The door slid open, and Adam steeled himself for the next part.

Fast as he could he shouldered the door open, illuminated the room beyond while moving into it, seeing nothing like ghostly white humanoid, and turned, bringing the light around to the door once more along with an overhead swing of the crowbar. A blood splattered figure frozen mid step in the doorway was decimated. Adam then kicked the door closed, severing its arm, and locked the door.

He forgot how long he sat there in that cramped room, crying and hugging his knees to his chest. All he remembered was finally emerging from the darkness into the cold autumn air and sprinting to the van. That, and the ceaseless, wretched scraping and grinding.


Adam drove in silence the whole time, going as fast as he dared to go in the diminished evening sunlight and rain. He couldn’t help but check the rear and side mirrors constantly. The feeling of being followed and watched hung all around him in the damp air.  

He wasn’t familiar with the township and without his phone had no idea where to go. He just picked a direction and floored it. The only important thing was putting distance between him and that hellhole. After twenty minutes of driving down the same road a sign directed him towards a gas station. Ten minutes later the glow of gas station lights loomed out of the twilight like an oasis in a desert. 

Adam parked the van and grabbed the crowbar. He just couldn’t let go of it for some reason. The gentle chime of the doorbell rang out as he slammed the door open and ran to the counter. No one was there. 

“Hello?” he called.

Adam looked about for the clerk or a phone in the dimly lit store and caught sight of himself in a mirror on the far wall by the soft drink dispenser. He stared at the grime and blood covered figure looking back at him, reaching up to prod a gash on his brow he hadn’t noticed.

“Geez…” 

The door slammed shut and he jumped at the sound. He slowly shuffled towards the manager’s office next to the storeroom, the soft patter of rain highlighting the stillness within.  

He slowly opened the manager’s office door, the crowbar held low but ready.

“Hey…anyone home?” he hefted the crowbar.

The room was lit, but empty. A laptop sat on the desk, open to a spreadsheet. On the opposite wall was a corded phone, worn with age. He lunged for the phone and grasped it like a lifeline in a hurricane, punching nine-one-one and holding it to his uninjured ear.  

The phone was dead.

He let the receiver go to fall and smack against the wall – right where the cord to the wall jack was cut. He slowly turned back to the counter. His breathing quickened and his pulse surged. A small sob welled up in his throat before he swallowed it back.  

Standing behind the counter was a mannequin, its pearlescent, featureless face looking back at him. It wore a denim vest and a brown toupee.

He squinted at its hairline. Red lines streaked from the hairpiece down where ears should have been and along its shoulders in sharp contrast to its white exterior. No, not a hairpiece, a scalp.  

An all too familiar cracking and snapping sound emanated from the storage room to his right. The sound grew closer with every breath.

He pushed his despair down and away, tightening his grip on the crowbar, the only thing that seemed real anymore. His face was etched with desperate determination. They were terrifying, sure, but they weren’t invincible, he thought, backing into a corner.

best served cold,"“Two million is a large claim. You do realize the insurance company will be investigating?” 

“Friggin Censors. No way they would allow my collection to debut. It was nearly fully edited into a montage composed to lay bare their conspiracy. Secrets long lost would have resurfaced. The Censors could not allow that. I suppose I closed my eyes to my darkest fear.”

“So you expect arson?”

“KABOOM. Yes, I should have seen it coming. I cringe as I remember black-and-white ghosts dancing in those white-yellow-orange flames. The celluloid fumes of the studio fire sickened me as I watched the Institute disintegrate. My treasure trove of lost film footage was obliterated with my dream. It was a crime. A crime against humanity.”

“You put a lot into this project?”

“I had searched all over Europe, in the oldest cinemas of rural towns, for silent movies that had been abandoned by Hollywood. I had spent over seven years on the project, relying on research and word of mouth. Footage of Chaplin being sworn into a cult in a candle-lit dungeon. Valentino in a stag film. All priceless examples of early Twentieth Century underground culture. The verboten. The blasphemous. Hoover in drag on the Riviera. I had meant to have the opening exposition in Berlin. No more. And now, what’s left? What can be salvaged? The films were at the Institute for restoration. An attack on the Institute is an attack on society.”

“Do you have any way of certifying their value?”

“Certainly. Meticulous records have been kept, including receipts and providence. But together, they were priceless. Worth well over the amount paid for them. I wish I had insured them for more. As for my personal loss, I’m not sure how my sadness and rage can be filmed. Perhaps it could be portrayed as a figure in cloak and hood, brandishing a scythe. Perhaps my soul would play death. You must find those responsible. Retrace my steps through Europe, and back to Hollywood. Somewhere, someone somehow will tip their hand.""

I turn my back on the burning cinders. I start my journey now. I will walk through the ocean if I have to. I will unlock the secrets of the sects my films uncovered. I will dig and probe and poke at the embers until a pattern emerges. 


Three years later. The insurance claim was denied.

Stella cuts a clean line into the surface surrounding her intended specimen. The donor is paralyzed. A hapless victim whose scream, if possible, would merely drown in the nearby traffic. Stella only works at night, to avoid the notice for her activities. Activities, which if the general public were to be aware, would be considered blasphemous.

Stella is a good girl. She is a favorite tool in my arsenal. I found her at an estate sale, among the contents of a surgeon’s home. Going from an x-acto knife to a scalpel seemed like a step forward in my craftsmanship. A scalpel has more flourish and elan. And to think I bought her for only fifty cents.

I named her Stella because that is Spanish for star. But as much as I love her, she is not the star of my collection. My true stars are the specimens plucked from the anonymity of late urban evenings that pull at my insides like midnight toward dawn. 

I gather the specimen into a ziplock plastic sandwich bag. Tuck it into my shoulder pouch. Now it is mine! I can not wait to get it home for mounting. It will nearly complete the set I’ve been assembling. I had been in search of something distinctive and pure. Something which would add clarity and poetry to the overall presentation. So when the moment comes to take it, I have a metaphysical orgasm. 

Such evenings! Sometimes I hunt after a night of garish drinking, stumbling home without a single care when I might spy the perfect addition. At such times, the temptation is as useless to resist as a tornado. I’ll take a victim in the middle of a sidewalk with such a speed no one sees. 

Other nights, I may awaken in the wee early hours to walk alone in the empty city streets. The thrill of the hunt heightens the senses. Red lights more vivid than technicolor, distant motor sounds more distinct than Dolby. 

I become one of the neighborhood shadows, a dark spirit creeping past dumpsters and graffiti in search of one unaware of their fate. I know at this time I will find them sleeping and vulnerable, plastered inside alley doorways or storefronts. Easy pickings if you’ve scouted early. 

In a frozen moment of time caught in the pale moonlight, I wield Stella to take my unflinching prize. I use gloves to drop my specimen into the waiting baggy.

Once comfortably at home, I sit at the counter of my studio apartment elated with the evening’s haul. The apartment is what one might expect, more like a dorm room with its loft bed. But at times like this, it is my rocket pad.

Once the world sees my completed composition, they will truly understand its enormity. Why it is serious art and must be taken as such.

I remove my specimen bags from my pouch. Laying before me I admire them. I love them. I thank them for joining me, and for informing me. I look upon each as a gift and treasure that one day I will bestow upon the world.

I look at the words I’ve cut from posters on street poles: 

Mascara

Jungle

Sphere

In this city, posters layer up on street poles like palm fronds in Jeruselum. I open the latest photo album in a series housing my collection of harvested words. Words that I place in the same grammatical order as the text of the Bible. 

It’s been a long slog and a labor of love. It took me three weeks to create my first ransom-style note, which was a rewrite of the first two verses of Genesis using found words.

In the beginning, God created the heaven and the earth.

And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.

On our Radio, Elvis played some Rhythm and BLUES.

But a Night has no ears, yet hears; why entertainment plays into a DJ for our Zombies.

For a bunch with Booze dancing thru our Monkeys in your Saturday.

This creative process is arduous at best. But in my heart of hearts, I know the end result will be magnificent. Hollywood will note its Avant Guarde genius.

But now I’m more careful. I photograph my specimens and post them to the cloud. This time, I tell nobody. I think I’m handling my setbacks quite well.",thriller
letting go,"It all came to a head when my mother-in-law died.

Mind you, I knew about my husband’s quirks from early on. The first time I visited his mother’s house I snuck a peek into his childhood bedroom on the way back from using the bathroom. I’d never seen anything like it outside of reality television. Stacks of magazines and newspapers covered the walls from floor to ceiling, and every spare bit of floor space except for a narrow path to the single bed was filled with piles of old toys, stuffed animals, and miscellaneous bric-a-brac.

But I was young and in love and I was certain I could change him, a project I began as soon as we moved into our new house.

“Here we are,” I proclaimed as we stood together in the third bedroom. It was definitely bigger than a box room, certainly large enough to suit my husband’s needs. “You can have this room for your own, we’ll put your desk in here as well as that hideous bachelor sofa and your bean bags. I’ll install some shelves on the walls and in the closet, so you can store your thousands of CDs. What do you think?”

Mark took a quick look around the room, nodding his head. “Seems OK. Although I am mortally offended by the slur on my sofa. It’s perfectly presentable, and who cares what a sofa looks like anyway? You’re sitting on it, not looking at it.”

“So we have a deal, then?” I reiterated, not wanting to get drawn into the sofa argument. “You can keep all your junk in here, just so long as the floor is clear so I can vacuum, right?”

“Whatever,” came the laconic response.

But as the years progressed, so did the accumulation of books, CDs, magazines, and unused gifts, until soon there was only a pathway to the desk, which was piled high with mail, old work stationery, and grocery receipts. The precious sofa with its objectional upholstery was buried under unwashed sweaters and old blankets. What you could still see of the window was grimy with dust as I hadn’t found an easy way to reach it to clean.

It got to the point where I couldn’t look at the room without experiencing feelings of anxiety. Mark must have grown tired of my martyred sighs because he began closing the door between visits.

My marriage was important to me, and I loved my husband, so I tried to see things from his point of view, to understand why he felt he needed to keep almost everything ever purchased or given to him. I spent one whole week cataloguing the fifteen boxes of music magazines he had stored in the garage, then comparing the result to prices online, desperately seeking some sort of justification for his ‘collection’. But it was no use, the magazines were worth less than ten pounds altogether. Minus shipping costs. And anyway, despite his talk of how valuable these things would be someday, there was never any suggestion of selling.

You may be thinking I should have sought professional help, but there was never any question of Mark getting psychiatric advice, or even marriage counselling. He’d made that clear early on. “I’ve never been to me, and I’m never going,” he declared, riffing on Charlene’s 70s pop song. I’d thought it was cute at the time, and oh so clever, because in addition to being funny and handsome Mark was very, very clever. Plus, I was sure he didn’t really mean it. But he did, and soon I found myself looking up symptoms and treatments for obsessive-compulsive disorders, searching for subtle ways to treat what might be an undiagnosed medical condition.

 

Based on my reading, I tried repeatedly to make deals with my husband, using any complaint as a bargaining chip.

“Do you have to play that iPad game every night?” he grumbled at me one evening.

“Tell you what,” I said, “I’ll stop playing if you’ll clean up your shit room.” (My names for the room had grown progressively coarser as time passed and resentment grew, which in hindsight probably didn’t help my cause.)

“Fine,” Mark snapped. “But I’m betting you won’t be able to go cold turkey on that thing.”

He was wrong, as it happened, I gave up playing the game immediately. But after three months I surreptitiously—then openly—began playing again, more frustrated than ever that there had been no change to crap central.

“Why not rent a storage space?” I suggested with what I thought was admirable reasonableness.

“I want my things near me, I check them all the time, I don’t want to have to drive to a storage locker to see my own stuff!” he responded, his voice gradually getting louder as panic set in at the thought of being separated from his beloved items.

As his mother got to know me better, she tried to get me to help convince her son to clear his stuff from her house, which I thought was rich since Mark’s hoarding problem was obviously one that should have been addressed in childhood. I could understand his parents, who had him late in life, being hesitant to consider a possible mental illness, but surely they must have noticed something amiss? And where was he supposed to put everything, in our already overcrowded home? No, I told her she would have to address the problem with Mark personally, and was unsurprised when everything stayed where it was. She depended on his goodwill too much since the death of his father. I began to dread the arguments to come after she died.

We’d been married fifteen years when that finally happened. As I hugged my crying husband and provided comfort and sympathy through the funeral and the death duties, my thoughts were constantly circling around the upcoming discussion of what to do with my mother-in-law’s house.

We found ourselves there on a beautiful spring day, the kind that makes you forget the grey drizzle that comprises the majority of British weather. The burglar alarm had gone off multiple times during the previous night and the neighbours had called to complain, so we ‘d promised to deactivate it.

As my husband dealt with the alarm I made my way down the hallway, looking into rooms as I passed. It was worse than I’d imagined. In addition to his own bedroom, the guest room was now crammed with baskets and boxes of clothing and paraphernalia, and I knew from my mother-in-law’s complaints that the attic would be similarly full. He must have been bringing stuff here over the years to avoid criticism, I surmised. It was definitely time to face the issue head on.

Mark found me gazing into his bedroom, trying to plan an approach that wouldn’t immediately make him defensive.

“What are you doing in here?” he asked suspiciously.

I turned to look at him, keeping my face as neutral as I could. He was still the man I loved. “Mark, have you thought about what we’re going to do with the house?” I asked gently.

His face closed up instantly, his lips compressed into a thin line, his eyes narrowed. “My mother has JUST died! Can’t you leave me alone for one second while I deal with that?”

I took a mental breath to stay calm. “It’s been three months, Mark. The house is sitting here empty, dark, and now without an alarm system. It’s an invitation to burglars, squatters, or kids looking for a place to have a good time. It’s getting dirtier, more shabby, more impossible to sell or even maintain the longer we wait. But I haven’t said anything before, and even now all I’d like to know is if you’ve thought about what you want to do with it?”

“No! I haven’t! And I won’t be rushed into anything! This is my house, and I won’t be told how to handle it by anyone. If you don’t like that, then you can leave, I’m tired of your constant nagging!”

Amidst all the wheeling and dealing over the years we’d always carefully avoided ultimatums, but here we were at last. Anger and despair welled up in me as I met my husband’s eyes, and I could tell he suddenly realised he’d gone too far. He’d given me a way out, and I was finally ready to take it.

That was when he pushed me into his jam-packed bedroom, causing me to trip and fall backwards onto a pile of papers. He grabbed the key from the lock on the inside of the door and pulled it closed. There was a click as he locked me in.

I sat there in stunned silence for a full ten seconds before jumping to the door. “Mark!” I yelled, pounding on the heavy wood. “Don’t be ridiculous! Let me out!” His footsteps receded down the hall, followed by the slam of the front door.

I looked around me while waiting for him to return, as common sense told me he must. From the yellowed state of the newspapers and magazines I could see at the bottom of the piles, I suspected there might be an issue or two that would prove valuable, particularly if they documented a famous event. Certainly, the ancient Dinky cars piled in a ratty cardboard box would fetch a bit of cash. But mostly, like in our own home, the room overwhelmingly contained stuff that any right-thinking person would have loaded into a skip years ago. I settled back on the pile of papers to wait.

***

It has now been four days and there has been no sign of Mark. I’ve spent the time seeking some way out of this prison. I managed to clear a path to the window, but it was triple glazed and locked tight. A search for something in the room to try and crack through the glass has proven fruitless, even the bed is only a mattress on top of a box-spring pedestal, with no handy bed frame to break up and use as a battering ram. It looks like Mark has gotten rid of any other furniture, probably to free up more space for his things.

The neighbours, close enough to hear a burglar alarm, have proven to be too far away to respond to my cries for help or to hear my increasingly bruised and bloodied fists banging on the window. I have no family to report me missing, no job, and Mark will have undoubtedly come up with a story to assuage any concerns raised by my few friends until it is much too late. I told you he is clever.

I have achieved a bit of vengeful satisfaction by defecating on some of his precious magazines, which I piled into a corner of the closet furthest from the bed to minimise the smell. It helped that I found a half-empty bottle of water that first day, which kept me going for a bit. But now even that pleasure is now denied to me as I have run out of the urine, and strength, necessary to fire up my revenge.

So here I sit, my thoughts confused and losing the will to live. My lips are dried and cracked, my throat burns. At least there is plenty of paper on which to record my tragic tale, although who knows if anyone will ever read this. What will Mark do when he finally returns to find my corpse added to his collection? Will he quietly bury me, or leave my bones amid these relics of his insatiable need to hold on to his past?

But wait…fire up my revenge. I wonder…

Somewhere in here I’ve seen a toy magnifying glass, like the ones you get in a Christmas cracker…. Yes! Here it is! The sun--that precious, bright sun--still shines during this unusual week of warm weather. All I have to do is reflect it onto this pile of newspaper next to the window…. OK, that’s definitely getting warmer.

Mark will not have the last word. I will burn this elaborate storage locker to the ground, even if I have to die with it. Maybe then my husband will finally learn how to let go. But you know what? I’m not counting on it.

As the first licks of flame burst into full-on fire, I’m using my last bid of energy to hide these notes in the middle of the still pee-sodden pile of magazines in the closet.  I’ll put a plastic crate over the top before I lie down on the bed for my final rest. There’s just a chance my story may survive as a warning to others. So if you find this and Mark is still out there, ladies, beware!",thriller
storage unit,"“Is this it?” I stop in front of the storage unit and check the number against the letter I am holding.

“Yep, number 5309.” My brother says from behind me.

“So what do you think we should do now?” I ask with a frown. I didn’t want to do this in the first place. When I received the letter from my grandmothers’ attorney I almost trashed it. She made her feelings very clear the last time we spoke 2 years ago and I had no desire to hear or have anything to do with her since then.

“I guess we open it and see what the old coot thought you needed to have, seeing as she didn’t think much of you.” He chuckles and raps on the storage unit door. I sigh and take out the key that came with the letter. I hold the key in my hand but hesitate to open the unit.

Laughing up at my brother I say with a grin, “What if she left me all her trash and wants me to clean it out? I mean she said I was trash so it makes sense.” He laughs and takes the key from my hand.

“Only one way to find out, lets open the unit and see.” He fits the key into the lock and I tense as I hear the click of the lock.

“Wait!” I say breathing hard as I put my hand over his stopping him from removing the lock. I don’t know why but I suddenly feel lightheaded and my chest hurts. I don’t want to know what is in there, I just want to put that part of my life behind me. I have come so far since she disowned me and wrote me out of her will. She said very plainly that her disappointment in me was bone deep and that if I were to continue on the path I was on she would write me off. Well I continued and she erased me from her life at least that is what I thought, until I got this stupid letter.

“My dearest granddaughter.”

Why did she start the letter that way? I was confused and a little bit apprehensive about her motives. The rest of the letter was just as confusing.

“If you are reading this letter then I have passed on. I know that we didn’t have the best relationship but you are my only grandchild and thus I am leaving you my most prized possessions. They are located in a storage unit outside of town. My attorney will give you the key and the directions. Warmest regards, Wilamina Wilkinson”

That was it, no I love you or heart felt apologies. Just as impersonal in death as she was in life. Her attorney had left me a brief note with the address of the storage facility and a small envelope with the key in it. They both had arrived a week ago via certified mail. It took me two days before I actually opened the package. My brother is the one that encouraged or more like threatened me to just open it or he was.

He is always encouraging me to step out of my comfort zone. My dad and mom met when Sam was 5 and got married when he was 6. He was the ring bearer at their wedding and he looked so cute in his little tux. Our parents said it was love at first sight and two years later I came along to complete the family. Even though there is an 8 year age gap between us it doesn’t bother him or me at all. We are and always have been very close and I don’t know what I would have done without him these last few years. Grandmother Wilkinson was my moms, mother and she came from “old money” and had the old ideals and opinions that came with it all. My mother was constantly telling me to just apologize and go see her. I refused since I was not in the wrong for wanting to live my life the way I wanted to. My mother let me know that she had passed away and asked me to come to the funeral. I refused since I didn’t want to have any emotions about her death since I had so many in regards to her when she was alive.

“What’s wrong?” My brother asks his brow furrowed in concern. “Are you ok?” He puts the key in his pocket as I shake my head.

“No, I am not ok.” I say a little shaky. “I don’t know what is wrong with me. I feel so conflicted right now.” I look up at him, my eyes stinging with unshed tears.

“Sis.” He says softly and pulls me into his chest and wraps his arms around me. I instantly feel his warmth, even though it is a bright and sunny day, I hug him back and let his strength seep into my soul. “We don’t have to look inside, we can just put it up for auction and cash the check.” I smile into his chest and look up at him.

“Thank you for saying that. I don’t know what is wrong with me. I know she hated me and my choices, so I don’t know what she could be thinking giving me her most prized possessions.” I shake my head and back away from my brothers’ warmth and comfort. “I mean this makes no sense. Two years ago…” I trail off and drop my hands to my side. I shake my head again and take a deep breath. “Ok I can do this.” My brother ruffles my hair like he use to when I was a little girl and it makes me smile, but I still slap his hand away and glare at him. He chuckles and reaches for the lock on the unit. I hold my breath as he takes the lock off and reaches for the handle. He pauses and looks back at me.

He asks softly. “You ready for this sis?” I nod and he pulls the unit door up.

We both look in the unit and gasp at what we see.

Boxes. That is it just boxes.

We walk into the unit. There is a small trail that leads to the back of the unit and on either side is box after box.

I look at the first box and inspect it. There are no markings and no labels. Just a plain brown packing box.

“You have got to be kidding me!” I say in exasperation. “That old bat gave me boxes?” I throw my hands up and spin in the small space. My brother chuckles and picks up a box. He grunts with the effort of picking it up.

“Dang, they are heavy!” I raise an eyebrow and cross my arms in front of me. He sets the box down in front of me and looks up and I give him an incredulous look. He rolls his eyes “No really they are heavy!” I reach over and grab one of the boxes and I am shocked to find that it is indeed heavy.

“Holy moly these are heavy!” I heave a box up and set it on the cement slap next to the one my brother has taken down. “So you want to open them at the same time and see what treasures await us?” He smiles and nods. “Ok, on the count of three then.” We both reach down and grab the edges of the box.

“One.”

“Two”

“Three”

Chapter 2

We tear into the boxes. He is much more efficient getting his open. I just rip the top flap a little. I laugh and gesture for him to rip my box open as well. He gives me a smug look and rips the top off of my box. He freezes and looks up at me slowly.

“Wow, sis.” My smile fades and I look down at what he is looking at. I drop to my knees and open the box more to get a better look.

“Wow!” I say reverently as I pull out a bubble wrapped crystal figurine. It looks like me. I unwrap it and hold it up. It is me and I am shocked. It is a depiction of me at 9 or 10 in a little ballerina outfit. My arms are arched gracefully above my head and I am caught forever in glass doing a perfect pirouette en dedans. I sit down holding the fragile glass. My brother has pulled out more glass figurines and they are all of me in different ballet moves at the same age. I look up at him, he has a baffled expression on his face. I too, am baffled and shocked.

“What are these and why do they all look like you from ballet?” I shrug and place the figurine back in the box. I look around me and my eyes go wide.

“Sam, you don’t think all these boxes are glass figurines of me do you?” I shudder at that thought.

Sam grimaces “God I hope not, that is creepy.” I nod my agreement. I get up and brush the dust off my jeans and reach for the next box. It is much lighter and I sigh in relief. Sam does the same and we both tear into the next set of boxes. The next box I open has folders of documents and papers in them. I glance at the top stack and I am puzzled to see my name listed on the front of the documents. I pick them up and open the folder. Inside is a list of property holdings. A long list of property holding. I am listed as the owner of them.

“Sam!” I say slowly as I hand him the list. He glances at it and then whistles low.

“Dang Jules it looks like you are a land Barron now.” I shake my head in disbelief again. This is just not real I think. Things like this just don’t happen in real life.

“Sam why would she have all this and list me as the owner of all this property? It just doesn’t make sense. I mean mom is her heir not me.” Sam shrugs and reaches for another box. I reach out and touch his hand.

“I think we need to have mom and dad here. They need to know about this and help me figure out what is going on.” Sam puts his hand down and nods.

I set the folder back in the box and reach in my back pocket for my cell phone. I find my mom’s name and click to connect the call. She answers on the first ring.

“Juliet, are you ok? What did you find? What did she do?” My mom says in a rush of concern and panic.

“I am ok mom but I think you and dad need to come out to the storage unit gran did...” Then is hits me what she said. “Wait, mom you knew about this?” I have a little bit of an edge in my tone.

She sighs heavily and I can hear my dad in the background asking if it is me on the phone.

There is some rustling and then my dad’s deep voice booms on the phone “Jules what did the crazy bat do?” I smile since my dad and grandmother never got along. She thought he was too pedestrian for my uptown debutante mother.

“She left me a storage unit full of boxes. I think you and mom need to be here. There are some creepy figurines of me and documents that say I own a bunch of properties.”

“Text me the address and your mom and I will be there shortly.”

I text them the address and look up at Sam. He is still sitting on the floor of the unit he is watching me intently. “You ok sis?” I nod and go to sit next to him.

“Mom and dad are on their way.” I feel better knowing that my family is going to be here and they are going to help me sift through the boxes and figure out what is going on. My grandmother may be gone but I feel like she has found a way to control me from the grave. I feel a cold chill travel up my spine and I shiver. Sam hugs me close and we sit in silence waiting for our parents to show up.

Chapter 3

Mom and dad arrive about 30 minutes later. Sam and I are sitting in my Jeep. Sam is asleep next to me in the passenger seat. I have always envied his ability to just sleep anywhere he lands. I on the other hand am holding the file that held the properties list. I wanted to Google the addresses and see what kind of property I was dealing with. Lots, all of them are just empty lots. They are all over the city and empty. What am I going to do with empty lots? I sigh heavily and lay my head back against the seat rest. I am glad daddy is going to be here. He can help me with the properties. “What were you thinking gran?” I say softly to myself.

A pair of headlight cut across my line of vision and then go dark. I drop the folder as I reach for my door, I shake Sam awake. “Mom and dad are here.” I say as I pull my door open. I bend to gather up the files that lay scattered on my floorboard. Once I have them all picked up I stuff them back in the folder and shut my jeep door. Mom is standing next to the Jeep holding out her arms. I step into her embrace and her rose and lily perfume calm my nerves and I just know everything is going to be ok. “Hi mom.” I say as I hug her tight. “I am so sorry…” I start to tell her how sorry I am about gran, but she just shushes me and kisses me on my cheek.

“I know baby girl, I know.” That is all she says and I fall apart. I let loose the torrent of emotions and tears I have been holding back for years. All the pain of my grandmothers’ last words hit me full force.

“Juliet if you quit ballet and drop out of college, you will no longer be welcome in this home.” I stood there staring at my grandmother in disbelief. “You have got to be kidding me!” I told her as she stood there stoic and stubborn in her perfectly pressed black slacks and white blouse. Her blonde hair up in a tight bun. Not a hair out of place. “Rest assured Juliet I am absolutely serious. I do not joke, I have paid for your education and dance classes since you were able to walk. I will not see you throw away a brilliant and promising career just because you want to do something, what was it again?” She asks.

“I want to work with children and be a dance teacher.” I say to her again. This time I am hoping she understands that I am tired of the demands that ballet has placed on me and my body. I don’t love it like I use to and I want to just try to instill the joy and pleasure I once had for dance into other children.

“Absolutely not, you will go back to school and stop all this ridicules talk at once.” With that said she turned to walk away.

“No! I will not and I don’t care if you disown me, this is my life and I am going to live it the way I want to.”

She turns slowly to glare at me. She is stone still as she gives me an assessing look.

“Then you are of no use to me and you are trashing your life for nothing. Leave and do not come back,” With that she walks away and slams her office door.

I hug my mom tighter and she rubs my back. “I loved her mom I really did, but she was just so unreasonable.” My mother nods and gives me one last squeeze.

“I know baby girl, trust me I know.” She chuckles and I smile because it was her mother and she definitely would know how she was.

My dad comes up behind me and ruffles my hair and gives me a quick hug. “Ok JuJu bug let's get the boxes out of the storage unit, I brought my trailer so it will be easy to get the boxes loaded.” I glance at the Land Rover and the trailer attached to the back. My dad always thinks about everything.

We make short work of clearing out the storage unit and in no time we are on our way to my parents house to unlock the mystery's that my grandmother has left for me. I am apprehensive but optimistic about what we will find. Based on what little I have discovered I am a little creeped out but I know there is a reason, because my grandmother always had a reason for everything she did. I am just thankful that I have my family by my side to help me unravel the storage unit mystery.  ",thriller
silence,"There is a peace at sunrise that surpasses all understanding. It's a renewal. A feeling that anything is possible. I’d like to say I drag myself from the comfort of my bed every day to enjoy sunrise’s splendor, but you wouldn’t believe me and I would be lying. What is true is I was there that day and so was she. 

There is a connection between sunrisers just because they are sunrisers. It’s a shared, yet unspoken, appreciation for things quiet and beautiful. That might explain why I was immediately drawn to her, but I know it wasn’t just because of the earliness of the morning. Delilah, you see, would have attracted me no matter the time of day. 

The first time I saw her I was sitting there, at my favorite secret spot, overlooking Lake Quinault. It’s a hidden gem in Washington State owned by the Quinault Indian Nation and, before that day, if I had my way, no one would ever sit and admire its beauty other than me.

The lake, a destination point for fishermen, swimmers, and sightseers, is nature at its most spectacular. It is located deep in the Olympic National forest. It isn’t easy to find, even if you’re looking for it. Once discovered, even the most magnanimous outdoorsmen will keep the secret to themselves. In an era where, too often, free time is wasted in front of a flat screen TV, Lake Quinault is a reminder of the reasons for taking vacations and the sunrise over the lake is God's definition of must-see. 

That particular trip occurred in early summer. I remember it vividly because I had to be in place just after 5:00 a.m. to catch the sun as it appeared over the mountain. Summer is the best time to watch the sunrise because no one in their right mind would be up early enough, nor would be hardy enough to make the journey to my secret spot. No one except me, and Delilah.

“Is this seat taken?”

Not many people can remember the first words spoken by or to the love of their life, but I absolutely can. That morning, as I turned to see from where the unexpected voice was coming, the first light of dawn revealed the most beautiful girl I had ever seen. Not all men might have thought so. Delilah wore no makeup, a pair of ripped jeans, and a faded brown hoodie. Her hair, perfectly auburn, looked as if it hadn’t been touched since she rolled out of bed that morning. It was obvious she had made no effort to look beautiful and yet she had an inner spark that couldn't be hidden. Not by tattered jeans or a faded hoodie. Something changed that first moment I saw her, I changed. I had spent years guarding my secret spot, and now, surprisingly, unexpectedly, delightfully, I wanted nothing more than to share my sunrise with her.

I, unfortunately, was not born a poet and as such the most romantic thing I could think of in response to her inquiry was: “It’s a free country.” With that, she invaded my secret spot, both next to the lake and in my heart. 

The silence that followed was both loud and revealing. Delilah wasn’t there for small talk; she was there to admire the beauty of sunrise. We sat in silence and watched as the sun peeked over the horizon, covering the two of us in its warming light. She and I carried on a conversation without words. She told me, silently, that she understood the importance of the moment, and I responded in kind that this moment was made all the more special because she was there to share it. 

Perfection is a goal impossible to realize in this mortal realm, but that morning came as close as is humanly possible. So many thoughts ran through my mind as the sun revealed itself completely. Then just as quickly and quietly as she had come, Delilah rose to her feet, wiped some residual dirt from the seat of her ripped jeans, and headed down the trail and out of my sight. 

Eight words verbalized, an infinite number of potential events contemplated. Thirty minutes had passed, a lifetime had been imagined. I was sure I would never see her again, and the thought made me overwhelmingly sad.

The next five years came and went, five long years since that day at the lake. There were first dates, first kisses, and the words “I love you” exchanged, yet every time fate or intention would reach down and sabotage promise. I became determined to find peace in my solitude.

There was always a reason or an excuse for my ending every potential relationship, but at its core was a shared sunrise and a conversation that didn’t happen. 

I went to our spot from time to time, to see the sunrise, not for her. At least, that’s what I told myself. I had given up without realizing I was hoping. Hoping to see her again. Hoping to feel what I felt that day. Hoping she would be there. And then it happened. It was once again summer, it was sunrise, but this time she was there.

“Is this seat taken?”

“It’s a free country.”

The same eight words.

At the time, I didn’t know that she, too, had often made the trip back to our secret spot.

Seeing her again, I knew I wouldn’t let the opportunity slip from my grasp, not a second time. When the sun had completed its part in our play, Delilah rose to her feet and wiped the dirt from her jeans exactly as she had done five years earlier. This time, however, I stood up as well.  

“My name is Peter. I don’t like coffee, but I’d really like to have a cup with you.” 

“My name is Delilah,” she responded, matter-of-factly, “and I would be glad to share a cup of Joe.”

She called it Joe? It’s funny the things that confirm that a love is real. I couldn’t tell her that day, for fear of losing her, but at that moment, I was sure. I had said “I love you” to others before, but it was obvious to me that I had lied. For in that moment, I was finally sure what love felt like.

Lifetimes are only lifetimes when viewed in reverse. A cup of coffee became a dinner date. A dinner date became a commitment. A commitment became a proposal, and a proposal became forever. There were kids and dogs and vacations, but more than anything, there were trips to Lake Quinault. Always at sunrise. Always just the two of us. Never any words spoken.

You never know the last time is the last time until it’s too late. The final trip we took to Lake Quinault was like all the rest. It took a little longer for tired, old bones to make the trek, but we found our spot, sat together, and conversed in silence. The sun, unaffected by time, rose as perfectly as always, but Delilah rose only with my help.  

“Would you like to share a cup of Joe?”

She knew I did. She knew sitting next to her pretending to like coffee was my greatest pleasure. She also knew she would never come back to see another sunrise even though I was too stubborn to admit it to myself. 

That day in the café, we told stories of family and friends, living and lost, as we sipped on what had eventually become my favorite beverage. We made a mental scorecard of our life and realized we had won. 

Two days later I lost her. Just like that first day at the lake, I watched her as she left me alone, this time without even the hope of returning. The sadness I felt from years back flooded over me like a tidal wave. 

I’ll save a seat for you. Those were her last words to me. True to myself, I replied: “It’s a free country.” Then, she was gone. 

One day, hopefully soon, I will watch the sunrise with my Delilah again only from a far better secret place. Until then, I only go to our special spot at night. 

I’m never alone when I go there. I make my way to our clearing and sit down just as I did all those years ago. As the moon reflects off the lake, I feel her comforting hand reach down for me, and in the silence only we understand, I hear her very clearly. ",romance
violet or red,"You were born on National Maple Syrup Day. Your mother names you Alcyone (pronounced AL-SEE-OWN-EE) because Alcyone means calm. It’s a cruel, unfitting choice given your family’s history of anxiety. You wish your name were something simple and easy-to-say, like Hannah.

By the time you turn nineteen, you've grown tired of constantly having to correct people. It’s Al-see-own-ee, you tell them on the days you have more confidence than usual, but they don’t hear you, and if they do hear you, they forget. As far as they’re concerned, you are Alison. Sometimes Alimony. As time goes on, you accept your fate as this Alison-slash-Alimony person and reason to yourself that your anxiety makes it difficult to correct people anyway. Plus, correcting others is rude, as your mother always told you, even though she had no issue correcting you herself—your wilted-flower posture, your questionable taste in clothing. 

It's not until your philosophy professor mispronounces your name on your twentieth birthday in front of 235 other students that you think about what this all means. Perhaps you are not important enough—not worthy of someone taking the time out of their day to string four little syllables together. Instead, they butcher your birth-given vowels like rotten cuts of meat, and you sit there, nodding along as if this is who you are.  

If you decide to start going by Hannah, go to A

If you decide to keep going by Alcyone, go to B



A

It takes some time to get used to the name Hannah. Like a new, stiff shoe, you work hard to break in the vowels—strange and foreign to your ears and tongue—until your new name becomes second nature. Now when people call you Hannah, you turn around. The name flows easily from their tongue, and it’s as easy for them as saying the word apple or tomorrow.

You tell yourself it was for the best—changing your name and all. Your name was too sacred for you to let other people butcher. Every time they twisted it, choking on the vowels like hard pieces of candy, it sounded like worms and toads coming from their mouths. You were only trying to save them.

Besides, while you may be anxious, you’re also practical. No matter how hard you tried to get people to say Alcyone, you’d never succeed. This way, everyone is happy, and no one can change your name ever again. You chose to be Hannah. You’ve always wanted to be Hannah, and now you are. This is completely your own doing. 

The next time you’re in philosophy, you’re learning about Kierkegaard’s Either/Or. Your professor takes an entire semester to explain it, even though it can be distilled to a few simple facts in a matter of seconds. 

1.     No matter what you choose, you will regret it. 

2.     We’re trapped in a bind of what Kierkegaard calls double regret.

That same year, you meet Sam, and you soon become Sam and Hannah. He says he’s always loved the name Hannah, and you wonder what would’ve happened had you still gone by Alcyone. Something about being Hannah makes you more confident and alluring. It’s like wearing a stranger’s skin—a stranger who happens to be more beautiful, more vocal than Alcyone ever could be.

Six months in, you decide it’s time to tell him the truth. That your name is Alcyone. You reveal the secret name to him slowly and carefully like a big, ugly scar or an incurable STI. 

To your disgust, he laughs and says he understands why you changed your name. He understands, a word that normally brings you comfort. He likes Hannah way more, he adds. 

If you’re being honest with yourself, you’re not completely crazy about him. You never were. In those moments of doubt you convince yourself that feelings grow—like plants—and that eventually you will feel something. There is something there, after all. It’s not like there is absolutely nothing. But still, by the time he proposes to you in the middle of a busy food court four years later, that stale, dry feeling is still there. 

You look at him, kneeling in front of a Hot Dog on a Stick, and think. Everyone is watching you. That anxiety, that doubt creeps back up on you, wrenching your stomach like a dirty wet mop.

If you decide to say yes, go to C.

If you to say no, go to D. 



B

You’ve resigned to going by whatever people wish to call you. Alison. Alimony. It makes the few people who actually do take the time to correctly call you Alcyone even more special to you. It weeds out the phonetically careless and narrows it down to the small circle of people who take the time to call you what you are, even when you insist it is not worth their effort. 

The next time you’re in philosophy, you’re learning about Kierkegaard’s Either/Or. Your professor takes an entire semester to explain it, even though it can be distilled to a few simple facts in a matter of seconds. 

1.     No matter what you choose, you will regret it. 

2.     We’re trapped in a bind of what Kierkegaard calls double regret.

One day that year, you meet Cody. He is part of your study group and asks you if your name is really Alimony. You say no and teach him your name. It normally takes about a semester to teach people how to say it, but for him, it takes seconds. In class and everywhere else, he is louder than you and talks more. When people say your name wrong, he tells them, self-assured, “It’s Al-see-own-ee.” 

Two years later, he proposes to you when you're alone, sitting on your couch, because he knows you hate it when too many people look at you at once, but more than anything, he knows your name is Al-see-own-ee.

If you decide to say yes, go to G. 

If you decide to say no, go to D. 


C

As the years go by, you wonder if this was the right decision. You tell yourself it that it was, yet you feel nothing for this person. In those moments you try to remind yourself of Kierkegaard. Had you married him, you’d regret it. Had you not married him, you’d regret it. You reason you made the right decision by marrying because now you are not alone and you will have babies and everyone, especially you, as you keep telling yourself, will be happy. 

But not even marriage is permanent, and as you hear him from across your home, making loud, vile bathroom noises with every orifice in his body, you question if he is worth it.

If you decide to divorce him, go to D.

If you decide to stay with him, go to H.



D

For whatever unknown reason, you miss him—even ten, twenty years later. The more time that goes by, the easier it is to forget why you left. 

You had your reasons at the time, but you've forgotten them. Now you are alone, but at least there are now fewer people in your life to call you the wrong name. You've always done well alone, anyway, but as the years go by, it becomes more difficult.

If you decide to meet new people, go to E.

If you decide to focus on yourself, go to F.


E

When you meet Ben, you're surprised how well he takes the news that your name is not actually Hannah. He thinks it's ""cool"" and only calls you it when he has something important to say.

""Alcyone,"" he says to you one day. ""I can't be with you anymore.""

Go to F.


F

In your newfound free time, you spend most of your days shopping. Eventually, you shop your life away, but this is what makes you happy--sorting through racks mindlessly, careful not to make the hangers screech.

Once you turn eighty-two, your body isn't what it used to be, but that questionable taste in clothing your mother always criticized you for is still alive and well.

One evening you find a dress, a form-fitting V-neck that compensates for its upper-half sluttiness by covering ninety percent of your legs. The dress comes in both violet and red.

If you choose the violet dress, go to I.

If you choose the red dress, to go J.


G

Something isn't right. There are unusual charges on your joint credit card, and Cody has, for the first time in the thirty-six years you've been together, invested in new clothes and a nose hair trimmer.

You know what is happening and are grateful you named the daughter you had together Rose--because sometimes, when you have a difficult name and not a simple one, you're too easily impressed when someone does as little as saying it right.

You decide to leave him. You'd rather be called the wrong name a million times over.

Go to D.

outdoor cafe,"I squinted my eyes as I looked at him, making sure it’s actually him that I see. What are the chances he would be here on a Sunday afternoon, at an outdoor café, 20 minutes from his house? The café that just so happens to be on the same street he knows I work at. Doesn’t he realize that the thoughts of him don’t just disappear and the words he said don’t just go away? Even as I step into my office, I can still picture him sitting at the table, slowly drinking his caramel latte that he gets every day. 

The picture of him doesn’t leave my head and neither does his voice that I haven’t heard in months. I do think about going up and talking to him, but why waste my breath? What would that do for me? Absolutely nothing. My shift isn’t going to be the same now that he’s on my mind. Now that everything is crashing back down onto me. Why did he have to be here? Did he notice I was there? Did he actually know that I had work today? Or is it all in my head? 

Even though I'm now struggling to keep up with my work now that he’s been implanted back into my thoughts, I'm not really complaining. I guess some things aren’t really meant to be. We were just one of those things. One of those things that the universe just didn’t allow. One of the many decisions that I didn’t agree with. 

Seeing him sitting there, almost unbothered with the universe’s decision of keeping us apart hurt undoubtedly. Why do I even care? I should be moved on by now just like I think he has. But there hasn’t been one guy since him, even though I know there’s been many girls since me. It’s hard to let go of something that tied a double knot around your heart.

The light shining through the windows woke me up. I groan and sit up to see him still sound asleep next to me. I kiss him softly on the cheek and get up to go make him breakfast, only to hear him shuffle around a little bit and say my name. He opens his eyes to see me out of bed and opening the door to leave his room.

“Come back to bed, I don’t wanna get up” he says and he makes me laugh a little bit to myself. “Not even for pancakes?” I ask back. He rubs his eyes and puts his face in his hands. “Not even for pancakes.” he mumbled. “I find that hard to believe.”

I walk out to his kitchen and grab the pancake mix. I make sure to get the chocolate chips and measure out extra just the way he likes it. As I turn the stove on, a strong set of arms wrap around my waist and pull me closer. “Look who decided to wake up.” I laugh and he turns around and kisses me. “Shut up”. I don’t know what it is about him that makes me go absolutely insane.

Unfortunately for me, the café that he is sitting at is in fact the café I spend my break at. So I can either go down there and pretend he doesn’t exist, or hope he isn’t there. Or I can always just not go at all, but where’s the fun in that? 

The café looks dead now and he’s nowhere to be found from the outside. Thank god because I was not looking forward to any sort of confrontation. I make my way inside and order my sandwich and coffee. It’s a small café, it’s more treated as a coffee shop than anything. It helps give me a different and quiet spot to do work though so it’s definitely a need. 

The worker gives me my coffee and sandwich and I drop my extra change in her tip jar. I make my way over to an empty table and sit down with my laptop and food. Oh what a decision that was. I look over my laptop screen to see him sitting a few tables away. He’s reading. He was always into reading, I don’t know how. I only read when I have to. He said it gave him some sort of escape from reality, whatever that meant.

“You remind me of a book character,” he says. I look at him. “How so?” He adjusts himself on the park bench to look at me. “You always seem to know exactly what to say and you’re always on your own time. It’s like you just see problems as little bumps in the road that are so easy for you to get over. I just don’t know how you do it.”

I kiss him and smile. He’s always so poetic and he’s saying I know all of the right words to say. It’s as if he knows exactly what situations are going to happen and what I'm going to say about them. Like he has a little script he keeps in the back of his mind written by the best authors that he just reads from. 

“What’s your favorite book?” I ask. “You are. I want to be in each and every chapter and study each and every page.”

See what I mean?

Present

I try not to look at him too much but I can’t help it. It’s as if each and every memory of us were displayed in front of me. I used to think that we turned into parallel lines, people that would never meet again, always a distance apart. Unreachable almost. But here he is, right in front of me, yet we are the same distance apart since the last ""I love you"". I guess I was staring for a little bit too long because he lifted his head and his eyes met mine. God I missed those eyes. 

They’re still the same cobalt eyes that calmed me down and looked at me like I was the only thing he ever saw. Part of me wishes those eyes were still there to guide me, but they aren’t, and they never again will be. I look back down at my laptop, and take a sip of my coffee. 

3 Months Ago

It’s the middle of the night and I’m driving to my sister’s house. We broke up. And I don’t know how else to handle this, and I know for sure I can’t do it without my built-in best friend. I’m not even crying, just numb. Nothing big even happened between us really, we just decided it wasn’t for the best. But how can I keep going through life without him? The life that we were supposed to live out together? 

Present

It’s probably not the best decision to stay here before something happens that shouldn’t. It’s about to be the end of my break anyway. I make my way back to my office and sit down at my desk. A large window sits in front of my desk overlooking the busy street below. The tall, dark-haired man walks out of the café and back down the street. I let out the deep breath that I've been holding in for the past minute. Part of me wishes he would make his way towards my office building door, but he doesn’t, and he disappears behind a corner. 

The night came quick and I’m now at home laying down, wrapped in the bed sheets he used to sleep in. My mind full of thoughts doesn’t stop spinning. Sometimes I can’t tell what’s worse, a mind full of thoughts, or a mind with none. Right now, it’s just full of memories. Not even just about him, but about everything since him. I wonder if he feels the same loss as I do. I wonder if his thoughts blended with mine as our eyes lingered to each other. Did the memories flood back to him too?

As much as I try to push him away, I can’t. Just thinking about him makes me upset. It makes me realize I lost my best friend. I pick up my phone, and type in his name. I stupidly bring myself back into an endless circle, I hesitate, and then text him. “Hey.”

",romance
outdoor cafe,"Jane spent her Friday night in front of the screen doing side missions for her newest game Badlands. She particularly grew annoyed with the current one, where you had to take out a horde of nomadic zombies just to retrieve some canned beans for some rando NPCs for another basic side quest. She wanted to throw the controller against the wall when the screen flashed DEFEATED, but they weren't exactly cheap and she already had to replace her first one.

She just bit her lip in frustration and continued, what else was there to do? She'd already done the main playthrough twice already, and all her friends were busy or too lazy to kick it and she too lazy to drive to them (this was a spread-out city). She continued through this redundant playthrough until she got mauled once again, and then opted for a tea break. Nice warm chamomile, then smoked a J and got back onto a comfortable position on her bed. If she couldn't beat it this time she’d go back on to good old Cowboys in Space 2. Yea, that shit never failed, cowboys and extraordinarily scenic skylines. She took another sip of her tea. You know, it may get a little lonely or rather, boring sometimes, but this is my best life, she thought, propping her feet up against the worn out ottoman and laying back into the cushion.

Then her phone buzzed loud, and it made her jump about a foot into the air. It was Cameron, Cameron the guy from college, the guy who knew how to live it up in the moment, the guy who almost convinced her marriage was a sensible enough prospect, also the guy who was temperamental, all over the place in your face, too loud and just too much for her. She found herself off on a tangent again and decided to just see what he had to say.

Hey Janie! I’m back in town and in the area, wanted to know if you wanted to chill for a minute?  

She put the phone down and pondered for a moment. I could hang, but what does he mean? As in go out and hang somewhere or ‘Netflix and chill’? How’s this gonna go? Friendly visit? Sexy romp? Or I wanna get back together? Could she even handle that right now?  Should I stay or should I go? Agh!

If he taught her anything, it was to live a little, and maybe that’s why I didn’t work out between them. She was a housecat, and he was a terrier, like the one she had back then, always running, jumping, begging to go on walks every 5 minutes then crashing at sundown only to wake you up with sloppy kisses at the crack of dawn. He loved that dog, even though he insisted he was more of a cat person which seemed an odd fit but she supposed opposites attract sometimes.   

Eh, she figured, what else did she have to do tonight? She might as well take advantage, between finishing her online schooling and her day job she might as well take a night to just chill.     

Hey Cam! Yea, it’s been a minute. I’m down to chill, just lemme put on a nice shirt.   

Dope! I’m heading up from Downey, you need a ride? I wanna go to a place in Pasadena.   

Nah, I’m good. It’ll be easier and less out the way for me to meet you there. Just send me the address.   

She went to her room to get ready and find that nice shirt. She noticed one of the little bracelets she had hanging on her hand jewelry holder; an old candy heart charm bracelet. That Cam had given her ages ago. It was a goofy old thing, a chain of candy hearts linked together with some cheapy looking metallic wire and red and pink heart jeweled charms in between, various cute (and a couple obscene phrases suggested by Cam himself), courtesy of his sisters line of kitschy costume jewelry for her Etsy page, fun grabs for the season. She smirked, picked it up and put it on her wrist, looking at the dangle playfully. She wondered why she even kept it, and she didn’t really know herself, other than she just couldn’t bear to part with the stupid thing. Her phone buzzed and sent her into a tizzy again before she just saw it was just someone posting another annoying video on her group messenger.

She decided to take the bus from her place in Eagle Rock, so they’d get there around the same time. And at around 7:30 she found herself in front of a nice enough-looking building; old school classy as per the general style of downtown Pasadena and led herself inside.   

It was spacious, with white lighting, black seating, gold trims, a little bougie. She felt a little underdressed in her jeans, red tank and a pea green pilot jacket but at least she brushed her frizzy hair and accessorized with a double chained peace sign necklace and some ruby flats. And the bracelet! She still had it on, she hadn’t necessarily meant to keep it on, was that too much? It did match a little with her ensemble? Then she saw him, those dark Coke can rounds atop his brunette sweep of hair, sitting at a little table by the bar. He barely turned and caught her eye. He smiled and waved her over. She slid the thing off quick, throwing it into her bright pink clutch before joining him.

“Jane!” He almost reached for a hug but sufficed for pleasant pat on the shoulder.

“Hey...it’s...”

“Been a while, I know. Come on, sit down.” He pulled a chair for her.

“2 whiskey gingers with Jameson.” He motioned towards the bartender who nodded.

“Of course...”

“Our favorite Irish drink for my favorite Irish lass.” She tried not to blush twisting a

smile.

“Ever the charmer still huh?” Cameron smiled.

“It’s good to see you Jane, really, I was afraid you wouldn’t show...”

“I didn’t think I would for a minute there.”

“And I would’ve understood after the shit I pulled...” He looked down. The bartender

handed them their drinks. “But things are different now, I’ve gone legit, doing game design.”   

“Wow really? That is legit.” She took a sip of her drink. 

“But enough about me. What are you up to these days?”

“Well, alright, I guess just plugging away at expensive online schooling for my sociology degree which may or may not, but most likely not, be of any use after I graduate but I’m enjoying the ride in the meantime.” She took another drink. Cameron scoffed.

“As long as your happy.” He took a drink. “You still doing your drawings?”   

“Eh, sometime when I have time, and the inspiration, of which I don’t have a lot at the moment…”   

“Ah, you should get back into that! You did some pretty cool stuff. Remember those comics about the superhero Radio-Heads?” she smirked.   

“Yea, that was fun…”   

“You should get back into that! What’s all this ‘more school for nothing’ shit anyway? You said after you got your bachelors you were ‘done with that life’?”   

“I changed my mind.” She took another longer drink.  

After a prolonged pause, Cameron spoke up again.   

“You wanna take a ride?”   

“What? Where?”   

“I know where, come on.”

He finished his drink, and after he spotted for the drinks, she followed his lead out the

door. He led her to a sleek black sports car.

“Holy shit is that a Jaguar?!”

“Yep. Just got her a couple months ago.”

“Wow…”

“Get in...” he tapped the FOB to open the door for her.

“How fast she go?” Jane asked sliding in cautiously.

“I've gotten her from zero to sixty in 5 seconds.”

“Niceee...” Cameron started the ignition and revved the gas. Jane nodded subtly, trying

not to act too impressed.

“And she's got a sweet sound system.” He cranked the radio. Jane winced. Cameron

smirked.

“You know it's sick.”

“Nooo...” she tried to deny with an upward inflection.

And so, they sped off as promised, the breeze blowing her hair awry through the open

window, watching the sparkling sea of lights below that was the city, blur by.

After what seemed like a brief few minutes they were at their old haunt, sideways neon sign lit up, THE KOROVA, at the door.  

Cameron opened the door for her, and she followed his hustle toward the club.  

""Ah man, I'm as giddy as a schoolgirl hearing that bass again."" The music did thump low vibrations though the walls.  

""So close you can taste the Moloko?""  

""The best!"" The bouncer checked their IDs and let them in through the doors to those familiar flashing lights and electric pulse. She heard the newest Weeknd remix reverberate through the walls.

""Man, I missed this."" He closed his eyes, spinning forward. He danced toward the bar. 

""2 Molokos my brother."" The bartender quickly obliged and slid them down to Cameron, who handed Jane hers.  

“Do me this toast to these good old times.” Jane obliged clinking glasses with him and

started on her drink while Cameron took no time finishing his. He placed his glass swiftly back on the bar. 

“Come on Jane lets go dance!” 

“I haven't finished my drink!” 

“Come on, finish it on the floor!” Cameron went off onto the dance floor. Jane shook

her head smirking.  She finished her drink and slowly joined him with her starter sway. Cameron was into it, and he had the moves. She watched him, moving faster, more rhythmic with the music, pelvic thrusts and sways, like a mix of the Weeknd himself.

He had this intense gaze when he was into shit, entrancing, his eyes shone gold in the neon lights and soon enough the two of them were grooving together quite nicely, Cameron taking the lead, and after some more intense staring and swaying eventually came the kissing.   

Then in the corner of her eye she saw the slender catsuited dancer come closer, inching towards Cameron. She ran a clawed black nail down his arm, and he obliged her, letting his hand drift casually down the side of her leg. He continued to groove with Jane, while petting the dancer, kind of sandwiched between the two of them. Janes mind was blurred with lights, rhythm and Moloko but not enough to really jive with this. She cut out, making her way towards the back door exit.   

She dipped into her clutch and pulled out a cigarette with her leopard pink lighter and had her smoke.   

“Jane! I wondered where you went ...” Cameron came towards her.  

             “It was about that time.” She exhaled a thin layer of smoke.   

“Seemed a little hurried.”  

“Yea well...”  

“I was just having some fun; thought you were too.”  

“Eh, this whole thing, I don't know, not my scene I guess.” She tapped her cigarette against the wall.  

“You feeling the edge of 30 already?”  

“I'm not getting old! I don’t know, just outgrown it all, I guess. I mean, even you’ve changed but…you’re still the same...”  

“What’s that supposed to mean?” She smirked.  

“It means I’ma call it a night.”  

“For real? It’s only...”  

“Almost midnight and I gotta work tomorrow.”  

“Pshhht all about that 9 to 5 huh? Guess you haven’t really changed either.” She shook her head, putting out her cigarette with her ruby red flat. He chuckled.  

“It's all good, I liked seeing you again.”  

“Tonight wasn't so bad.” She smiled.  

“Don't be a stranger yea?”  

“I'll try my best. You have my number.” She tapped at her phone ordering her Uber.  

“Right. I’ll see you around Janie.”  

“See you around Cam.”  

She looked out the window, into the slowly darkening hills of Hollywood. She saw something flash in the corner of her eye, like a shadowy figure running along the edge of the road. She swore she saw a pair of gold eyes meet her eyes for at least a split second, but double taking, she only saw the dim streetlamps in the passing distance. She blinked her eyes and shook it off. She checked her phone, 12:25am. She yawned, chuckling at herself. She put her phone back in her clutch and saw the bracelet there. She took it out, examining it in her fingers, smirking and shaking her head again. She lowered the window, throwing it into the shadows below. ",romance
hold on,"The trees blur right on sight as I pass each one slowly, driving to our place. I can't even understand why I'm torturing myself like this, but I need to do this, it feels right. It feels like closure, like letting go, but it also kinda feels like grabbing on.

I finally arrive at our place. The burgundy couches still looks as polished as before, one might say that they even look new. Did they buy new couches?

I brisk walk to our favorite couch.

The waiter comes to my table to attend to me. She flashes a full smile and I successfully force a smile back.

I am just here for dessert. I say before she can utter any word.

Ice cream. Please...

The familiar scent invades my senses and I see him in from of me. I feel his presence, and I see his smile.

You look beautiful today, as always.

I smile with pride and think of a modest answer to give.

Then the voice rings in my ears.

Ofcause you look beautiful. You know it, you took two hours preparing yourself.

My third ice cream bowl arrives. I somehow wonder if I should substitute this for tequila shots.

I sit and look around while I drown myself in ice cream. A cozy laughing couple sitting not that far from me brings back nostalgia.

They are whispering to each other, holding hands and looking deep into each other's eyes.

They are going to break up one day, I think with a sigh.

I see the waitrons stealing glances on my side as people come and leave.

I remain. Still infused in my self imposed ice cream eating contest with myself.

Mam, we closed 15 minutes ago. One voice says apologetically.

I'm so sorry, please give me the bill.

*********

I am driving fast today, to head to my well of memories, I want to do this, I don't know why. Maybe I want to feel something, maybe I want to relive those memories.

The host at the door greats me excitedly.

He leads me to our...my usual table.

The waiter greats me, I smile.

Ice cream.

I think about him again, about us, especially about our first date. How nervous we both were, but every time he held my hand, or look at me, I felt it, that electricity that indicated that he was the one.



You look sexy in your oversized pajamas.

You look so beautiful when your hair is messy.

I'm so lucky to have you.

Why do you keep on saying that you are lucky to have me?

Because of everything that you are.

We continue to eat.


I am at the Waterfall Hotel and looking at the waterfall from the window.

He wakes up, I look at him and we smile. We share a short kiss.

I wait for the compliment, there is none. I feel my stomach churn and I force a smile.

How did you sleep?

I slept well, how about you?

Great.

Do you wanna watch Tik tok?

We watch Tik tock videos.

He tells me about how lucky he is to have me and how he wouldn't have it in any other way. I feel relieved, and things feel normal again.

He continues to compliment me as I begin to think about the essay due in a few days.

I feel the necessity to finally say it...

I'm going to date someone else in the future?

Does this mean that I can't keep a man? Does this mean that I can't make a man stay?

He is my first love and we have to be together forever.

So, I snap out of my thoughts and I listen to him.

""You are the best woman for me.""

I smile.

He takes out his phone and we watch videos on Tick tock.

We take pictures with me making bunny ears on his head, we both have our tongues sticking out and people flood the comment section with hearts and words to express their envy.

I will tell him another time.



The white throw is spread around the lush grass. Red rose pedals are spread all over it. I'm blushing in disbelief and happy that someone went out of their way for me.

I have to tell him how I feel, I have to end this. He deserves better than this.

I get a choking feeling every time I want to utter the forbidden words.

He is a great , he loves you, he is humble and sweet and he would never cheat on you. What else do you want?

I smile and feed him a strawberry. We smile at each other. We take our phones and play games in silence.

Is this a comfortable of uncomfortable silence?

I need to tell you something...

Yes, what is it?

I think that we should break up. This is entirely my fault, I know, but, we should really break up.

I feel my stomach churn and my heart race.

A tear falls from my eye and I stare at him in disbelief.

He takes a deep breath realizing what is unfolding.

I see panick in his eyes and instant regret.

I have no idea why I said that, I'm really sorry. I didn't mean it and I don't ever want to lose you.

I know.

But you know that we have to do this.

Why does it feel so terrible?

Because we love each other.

Let's not break up.

I nod in agreement and we hold each other.

I love you.

I love you way more.

Crickets.

You look beautiful today, you always do.

Thank you.

There's this pretty sick video that I saw on Tik tok.

Wait...

What's wrong?

I'm going to walk away, and we will never see each other again. It's not you, I have to do this. Don't contact me or try to get back together.

I immediately pull away from him, he is stunned. I turn and walk in an opposite direction, I turn and see his shocked face looking at my direction.

I continue to walk on and fight the urge to turn around.",romance
traces,"I sat on the front porch just as the sun was setting. My feet were up on the glass coffee table, and I could see grains of sand stuck around my toes. The chimes that dangled from the neighbor’s patio swayed in the light breeze. Sipping on the Pimm’s my dad had mixed for me, I studied the houses lining our narrow street, admired the trimmed sidewalks, the sandy pathways that led down to the beach. I’d sat here many times, at all ages, all heights, all varying awkward stages of puberty and studied this exact block. Watching families pushing strollers, beach-bikers cruise as the sun set, toddlers holding sand shovels and pails, it normally felt like such peace.  

I took a long pull of my drink and eyed a young couple, late twenties I guessed, walking hand in hand coming from the beach path. They were smiley, giggly, fingers deeply intertwined, walking perfectly in-step. I guessed they were fairly new. Less than a year in. They had that early, euphoric energy. I guessed they’d recently said “I love you” to each other. Probably somewhere kitschy like a Ferris wheel or someone else’s wedding. I guessed they already had a song that was “theirs.” I watched them stop and kiss in front of the Herman’s garden. Pimm’s to my own lips I rolled my eyes. I found their love loathsome and recognizing that other peoples’ relationships made me irritable then made me more irritable. I find bitterness to be an unbecoming quality, yet here I was sat arm in arm with it.

Succumbing to my dark companion, I continued to make assumptions about the couples’ inevitable life together: the traditional wedding with the fun flair of a “dessert table,” the perfunctory two bath two bed in the town he grew up in, the hypo-allergenic fluffy dog that would eventually be used to announce their pregnancy (in my head they put a shirt on the dog that says “big brother” but you can imagine what you wish). They would have an incredibly happy life together. I ruminated on the bits of cucumber left at the bottom of my glass until they were down to a pulp. I envied such normality. Their life path was so clear.

My friend, Sam once described love to me as “a color she’d never seen.” I’m sure it’s pretty obvious, but I’ve never been in love. I’ve gotten scholarships, scored perfect test grades, earned promotions, traveled the world, run a marathon, been blessed by the Pope, maintained a consistent size 2 for my entire life, but I’ve never been in love. So, to many (most egregiously, suburban mothers) I am still “finding myself.” 

I live alone in Los Angeles and one time my engaged friend, Maria, FaceTimed me to show off a potential rehearsal dinner dress. “I would show you the back,” she said, angling the camera in the mirror, “but I’m alone, so I can’t zip it up.”

I wondered how she thought I dressed myself in the morning.

In general, I have a lot of friends and would consider myself generally well-liked and kind. I do find happiness in their happiness. I just can’t relate to everyone who’s seeing the color, let’s call it “pur-quoise” or “yel-urple.” I’ve tried, trust me. 

The wind blew my hair across my eyes. I carefully pulled the blonde strands back and sank deeper into the wicker chair. Normally I liked sitting out here at sunset. Sometimes I’d bring a book or a puzzle, other times Charlie would sit with me and we’d just talk or nap. But even before the couple walked by, I felt vaguely sad. A hollow, emptiness that wasn’t big enough to be called depression, but didn’t go away with a good night’s sleep, had settled in just as I arrived here with my family. I felt somewhere between “on edge” and “in a funk.”

Despite years and years of me, Charlie, and Ethan piling into the backseat of our Highlander, smushed between towels and boogie boards, playing games to drown out whatever our parents were fighting about in the front seats, the beach felt less familiar. Less innocent. That last time I’d been here wasn’t with my family, it was early last autumn to meet up with Oliver. 

We’d been seeing each other for a while before he invited me to his family’s timeshare in Avalon. I excitedly went (after sending all outfits for approval to Maria) and played house for the weekend with Oliver, all of it feeling very natural. Him cooking me bacon and eggs every morning, borrowing bikes from the garage to ride along the boardwalk, finishing the day at a winery or playing Mario Kart. The back of his house was along the bay, and we’d sit on his dock, sipping drinks and looking around, observing, taking it all in. I thought that was something special him and I had in common, we liked to take in the world around us.

The unlatching of the screen door knocked me out of my daydream. I heard a small bark and turned to see Rosie’s black fur rush towards me. “She was crying to sit with you,” Mom said before disappearing back inside just as Rosie hopped up on my lap and made a little circle. I moved my empty glass to avoid her wagging tail and pressed my cheek against her soft ear as she settled.

I closed my eyes, face still buried in Rosie’s fur. The wind picked up, growing louder. It was like I could hear the sound of Oliver’s laugh carried in the breeze. I opened one eye and quickly scanned the street, but he wasn’t there. I had a fear I’d run into him here, I suspected that was largely why I felt so unsettled. I imagined what would happen if I did see him coming down the street on his bike, a bottle of wine tucked into his sweatshirt pocket. I imagined he’d stop if he saw me on my porch. He’d probably make a big showing of riding without touching the handlebars, a devilish grin on his face, completely unaware of how much I had cried over him.

“Charlotte!” he’d call. 

My body would freeze, just for a moment. Eventually I’d come to and smooth my hair and straighten my posture. Hopefully I’d be wearing something effortless, like, I don’t know a low-cut summer dress or a push up bikini. Not that I needed to look good for him, but in my daydream, I’m allowed to look as good as I want. 

“Oliver,” I’d managed to breath. “Fancy seeing you here!” I’d forced a smile and a small laugh. I was not a “cool” girl, but I’d try.

Oliver would look the same. Thin yet handsome, blue-eyed, with the attentive stare of a luxury car salesmen. The kind that coerced you into believing you were meant for a car like this, that you and you alone deserved it. 

“Wow, is this the dog you were going to get?” Oliver would ask, acknowledging the Spaniel puppy on my lap. “You actually got one!”

“Yes, meet Rosie,” I’d answered, thankful for the easy conversation target. Rosie would probably already be belly up in front of Oliver, eager for a pet. “She’s a real guard dog,” I’d joke, making a mental note to up her training. Thankfully she was my parents’ dog and not really my responsibility.

I’d watch him rub her belly and take a deep breath, waiting for what would be said next. There was a lot I wanted to hear, an apology, an explanation, but even in my fantasy I couldn’t picture that happening. There was enough said in the unsaid between us that I wasn’t looking for closure or anything. I never really liked the idea of closure, anyway. If someone’s stopped seeing you, it’s because they didn’t’ want to see you. Pretty simple to me. I imagined we’d talk about LA, how the indie band he managed was doing, the fact that he’d recently moved to Philadelphia and bought a house there (I saw that on Instagram). I’d pay the cost of a house to never live in Philly, but that’s just me. A city full of greasy cheesesteaks and sports fans that climb light poles.

Overall, I wasn’t really sure how to direct the rest of our made-up conversation. My daydream had no end. I had nothing that I was dying to say, it was just that Oliver had lived in my mind for so long, the act of being back in a place that we shared together allowed him to re-claim that brain space. I opened my eyes and rubbed Rosie’s head as I surveyed my street again. I wondered how it was possible that my mind could hold so much, even when my reality wasn’t demanding more.

I feel like it makes me sound crazy to admit that. To admit that there’s nothing I really have to discuss with Oliver, yet my mind can’t let go. It wasn’t like I was sending him drunk texts or writing letters I’d never mail. Sam told me she felt like this over guys from her past, too. I was happy she’d said that. I can’t imagine Charlie ever admitting that he thought about girls long after they’d left. I can’t imagine my brother even thinking about a girl if she wasn’t right in front of him. The way he tore through women in the city astonished me. Somehow his “nice guy who’s just busy” act seemed to work. I love him, but I hated that.

For my twenty-eight years on this earth, I have brain storage for men I’ll absolutely never see or speak to again. I carry the experiences of others in my repertoire. Every time I order Thai Green Curry, I get the sticky rice because Joe introduced me to it. I can thank Stephen for my Flywheel membership. I’ll never see him in spin class, but it’s become one of my favorite hobbies. Josh showed me Stone Street, Mark showed me extra dirty martinis. I can throw away pictures, give back sweatshirts, delete text threads, but there are parts of previous partners that have become who I am. It would be impossible to untrain my brain in association.

Later that week I went to Swirls with Ethan, Charlie, and Dad and remembered that Oliver liked blueberry ice cream. When our family played arcade games on the boardwalk, I remembered that Oliver was captain of his basketball team. I heard a Thundercat song and remembered how we’d jokingly danced in his kitchen, arms around each other’s waists. My mind couldn’t let go.

Honestly, I think the only real cure is to replace him with someone new. Unfortunately, no one good has come around in a while. The world was still very much in primary colors.

I laugh when I think about Ethan and his wife, Molly. They met in high school. They never dated other people. Never experienced heartbreak, a ghosting, a “nice to meet you but I don’t feel a spark” text. Never had to schlep through the apps or bring a pair of purse underwear just in case the date went well (Sam and I came up with that idea). What could their brains possibly hold? Did Ethan really just go for ice cream and enjoy the act of dessert without any intrusive thoughts? Could Molly just turn on the TV without fear of being triggered by a memory? Did they both just… live?

Sometimes I think I lose a little piece of resiliency every time love doesn’t work out. I’m jealous of Ethan and Molly in that way. But I also gain a silver of variety to my life. Something that wasn’t there before. Oliver will fade more and more. He will be replaced by new hobbies and foods and vacations. But all of those men, every last one, aren’t gone.

There are little traces left behind.",romance
post,"My dearest Cora,

I don’t know how to begin. I’ve been staring at this blank page for the better part of an hour, I think. I tried everything to reach you and Rebecca before finally coming down here. I’m in the Jolesons’ old fallout shelter, under the hatch in the floor of their garage. You remember, don’t you? I suppose that if you’re reading this, you’ve reached the house and you already know all that. Please hurry. God, I pray that you’re both safe.

I don’t know how I imagine this will reach you. I’m writing for the sake of my own sanity, I guess. I can’t stop thinking about the two of you; the power and the phone lines in town all went out when the bomb hit, and all that came through on the CB was static.

It was horrible. Everyone was screaming. I could hear them outside, could see them through the window, running in the streets. I stayed at the house for what must have been three hours, trying to get you on the phone and hoping the power would come back. Then the old air raid drill sounded. I left directions on how to get here just inside the front door if you’d forgotten, or in case this only reaches you, Becks.

But is the house still there? Is the town? I felt the impact of the second bomb soon after I holed up down here. The whole bunker shook and rumbled and it felt like an enormous swell of the ocean crashed overhead. All has been quiet since.

Oh, Cora, Becks. Please come. I pray that you’re safe and that you can find your way to me. I keep trying the CB, but there’s nothing.

God, what have they done?

August 19

I woke up in the dark of this place and thought it was all some terrible nightmare. But it’s true: They really did it.

I can’t believe I’m here. Can’t believe this is happening.

Cora, where are you?

August 21 (?)

Before all this happened, I couldn’t believe that Joleson maintained this place so many years after the Wall came down. Here I thought he was paranoid, but I guess the joke’s on me. On the bright side, there’s more food and water than you would believe.

I keep waiting for someone to start banging on the hatch. I don’t know if Joleson made it, but the fact that I’m still alone down here leads me to think that he didn’t.

Of all the times for us to be separated, Cora, I keep wondering why it had to be now. It’s just too cruel, too unfair. The one thing that’s keeping me going is the hope that this camping trip you’re chaperoning took you both far enough into the mountains that you might have escaped harm. But how will you get back to me, or I to you? They say that the radiation is the real killer after the bombs fall – how long until it’s safe to leave? 

Later

I’ve been staring at the hatch most of the day. It’s funny to put things in those terms; I have no sense whatsoever of day or night down here. The whole place is flooded with light when the generator kicks on, and I’m in absolute darkness when I switch it off. The dark is better most of the time. I lay on the cot and look up into the blackness and pretend we’re watching the night sky like we did on our camping trips, Becks.

What happens when the generator runs dry? There are candles and a crank-flashlight on the shelves, but will I really be here that long?

August 

I’m growing a beard. Itches like hell.

This canned stuff isn’t so bad, but I’m already sick of it.

I’ve been keeping the place clean. Sometimes I’ll zone out just enough and it feels like any other day at work. Old habits, I guess. There isn’t much else to do; I found a pack of cards that Joleson thought to stash away, but my poker face has always been lousy. Mercifully, so is my only opponent’s (ha ha).

August 

Becks,

Had a dream last night that we were at that summer camp you went to when you were eight or nine, when I came to pick you up after the first day and you were crying and said you didn’t want to go back. Remember that? I don’t mean to embarrass you, but we sure had fun that summer anyway, didn’t we?

I wish that I were there with you, at what might have been the End, but I guess it’s safe to spoil the surprise now and tell you. The reason I couldn’t come along on the trip with you two was that I picked up some extra shifts so that your mom and I could buy you a car, come October. Seems like such a trivial thing now, but I know how important these things are at your age. It’s not the one you wanted, and it has a few years on it, but like I explained before: With a first car, it’s not the bells and whistles that make it special. The freedom’s the thing.

I’m thinking of you always.

I love you girls so much.

August --

I can’t remember praying even once since I left St. Christopher’s at fifteen, until I came down into this little room. It’s become something of a regular ritual down here. Is God still out there, when the rest of the world might not be?

The terrible roar of the second bomb and the sound that followed – that huge, whooshing sound that swept overhead – keep replaying themselves in my mind.

Am I the only one left? Surely not.

I find myself speaking aloud down here just to hear the sound of someone’s voice.

Am I losing my mind?

Cora,

I keep waking and thinking for a moment that I’m in our bed, and that when I reach for you, I’ll feel your warmth and your body next to mine. It’s the two or three seconds of my day that are the most precious, but oh, the sting of disappointment when the cold reality comes crashing in never seems to diminish.

I hate it here. I miss you terribly.

August?

Why do I write? There’s no post, no one around to deliver any of this. I pick up this pen and scribble and continue on as if you’ve received my last letters, but here they all sit in a little stack on the cold floor of this place.

Are you worried about me? Do you think I'm dead?

Are you still out there? 

September?

I hadn’t wanted to write this, but I don’t think I can deny it any longer. It’s beginning to sink in that no one is coming here – that maybe no one’s left up on the surface for miles and miles. 

There’s food and water to last for the foreseeable future. It’s warm and it’s not terribly uncomfortable. But I’m coming to understand that while these things are enough to survive, they’re not enough to live. A man alone in a hole without his family is nothing at all. 

Later

I can’t stop crying. The photographs of you both that I kept in my wallet are all I have down here. Please be alive out there, my girls.

September --

I’ve decided I’m going out. There’s nothing for me here but worry and heartache and a thin, torturous hope that does more harm than good. 

“Tomorrow” will be the day. I’ve lashed together a makeshift harness for a large pack of food and water and a bedroll. It’ll be just like our camping trips, Becks. I wish that we could go on them again someday, in whatever’s left of the world above.

If I find that the town has been leveled, I’ll head west after you, into the mountains.

God, please guide me home.

My love,

How I wish that I were writing you a love letter under different circumstances. I can’t remember hand-writing you a letter since I asked you to come with me to Madison back in college, but I hope you knew that every day we spent together was love letter enough for me.

Cora, you are my anchor and my home. My memories of you have sustained me in this dark and quiet place, and I am so very grateful for all the many years we shared together.

Please forgive me all the times I failed you. Know that I only ever wanted to make you happy, and I hope that I’ve accomplished that to some measure, despite my many shortcomings. Thank you for sticking it out with this old mop-pusher. I always wanted to be more for you, and it seemed like there was always something brighter just around the bend, but it looks like there wasn’t enough time. We sure made it work though, didn’t we, lady? We built our little nest and filled it with our bluebird, and a man couldn’t have asked for anything more wonderful than that.

Take care of Becks, my love. She’ll need you now more than ever before. Tell her often how much I loved her, won’t you? She’s growing to be so much like you, and I love her all the more for it. I saw her dancing with a boy at school, and some petty part of me wanted to grab the kid by the shoulders and give him a good talking to when he put his hands on her hips, but I guess that’s what dads do. But you should’ve seen her, Cora. She was so happy, and she looked so beautiful – she had that same bright look on her face that you had when we went and saw the baby penguins. Remember that?

God, I love you, Cora. When I climb out of here, I’m going to do whatever I can to find you. If I can’t, and what’s left of the world above takes me, then I’ll die with your name on my lips and with all my fond memories of you behind my eyes. If you and Rebecca are already there, in that Place After, then I hope to come swiftly to be with you again.

Goodbye, Cora. Think of me and I’ll be with you, always.

All my love,

Frank

Rebecca Marie,

My hand trembles as I try to write. How does a father summon the words to say goodbye to his only child? This is the hardest thing I’ve ever had to do.

My love for you is beyond expression, Becks. You are the laughter in my heart and the very warmth of my world, bluebird. I wish I could have done more to make you happy, and that I could have been more to make you proud of me. I understand why you didn’t always warm to me when we saw each other at school. It’s not too cool to be seen swapping hugs with your dad, even less so when he’s the janitor. But remember, if this reaches you, that hard work and an honest living are more important than the money a person makes. Whatever you do and wherever life takes you, know that your dad has always and will always be so very proud of you, my dear. 

Please bear me no ill feeling for all the times I was sharp with you. Sometimes parents have to be that way. I tried to be the best dad I could to you, and while I may not have said it enough, you need to know that I love you more than anything in the whole world, Becks.

I have a confession to make: I sneaked away from work during that spring formal in April and kept an eye on you. I was supposed to be across campus mopping the halls, but some things are just more important than work, kiddo. I wish there was enough time in the world for you to grow to understand.

Your mom and I had worried that you might have trouble making friends at first, because you were always a bit shy, but when I saw you in that circle laughing with all those girls, my heart swelled up and I knew you were going to be just fine. I thought, ‘How lucky those girls are to have a friend like her. They don’t even know what they’re in for.’

You looked so beautiful in your dress, with your hair all done up like that. Mom sure knows her stuff, huh? I may not get to see you grow up to become a woman – and it shatters my heart to think on that – but I caught a glimpse of it there on that dance floor, with you smiling into that boy’s face with those big green eyes your Mom gave you (lucky you). It was a wonderful thing to see, and I’m so thankful to have that, at least.

I wish that you had the chance to have a family of your own, to know for yourself the overwhelming joy that you’ve brought into our lives. You’re the best thing that ever happened to us, baby girl. I miss you so much, I feel like my heart is drowning. I know that every little girl dreams of her wedding day, but dads dream of these things too: I imagine walking you down the aisle, all grown-up and smiling and lovely, and you sharing a dance with your dad before you finally go off to start a family of your own.

I’m coming out into the world to find you now, and on my journey, my love for you and your mother will shield me as a blanket against the cold. If I don’t make it, never forget how much I loved you, but don’t grieve yourself mourning for me; be strong for your mother, and know that I’ll be looking after you both.

You’re my world, Becks. Goodbye, bluebird. God willing, I’ll be with you soon.

More love than you’ll ever know,

Dad",romance
memory of you,"They are late…They were supposed to be here 30 minutes ago. It’s 9.30 now. Brrr…haaaah ... .I’ve  put on the heater and yet, I can still see my own steamy breath. Rubbing my hands doesn’t help, either. I don’t know why it’s really cold today. I hope they are alright. I haven’t seen them in awhile.

Ding dong….Ding dong…

Ah, here they are…

“Coming!”

“HEY!”

“Hey you guys! I started to get worried. Good to see you. Come come, come inside. It’s really cold.”

It’s Jean and Brad. My two closest friends, if not the only ones. Jean was a friend of mine from college. When she met Brad, she introduced me to him as well. Thought you needed a guy friend, she said. Well, she was right. Brad and I are now best buddies. I’m glad I have him as a friend. They have been married for two years now after dating for two. I’m happy for them.

Now, their purpose of visit is not just to hang out. Though that’s what they would say and do when they are here. But I know what they’re doing. They’re worried about me and they are checking up on me. I always appreciate that. I always tell them I’m fine…because I’m fine. That’s what I think at least.

“So…how was your trip? Sorry, I don’t have anything fancy to serve. Hot tea and some cookies for you.”

“Oh, it was so lovely, John. You should’ve seen the view. It was just breathtaking. Thanks for the tea.”

“Yeah, bro. Munch…munch… Beautiful. Never seen anything like it. You should take a trip there too sometime. We can go together next time. Ooor…if you prefer, I can introduce you to someone, get to know each other a bit and you two can go there together. She’s lovely. What do you say, John?”

“Babe, stop it…”

“What? I’m just helping my buddy out. And these are very nice cookies, by the way.”

“Hahaha…it’s alright you two. Thanks, Brad. I can’t give you an answer now but I’ll think about it. And I’ll give you a pack of those cookies. I have some.”

“That’s my buddy. Thanks man.”

“Hahaha.”

Brad is telling me the story about their trip. I can tell he enjoyed it very much. He’s never been this excited before. I guess if it makes Brad feel this much, It could probably help me a little bit too. I guess we’ll see.



Oh, would you look at that. It’s almost noon. Time flies. I don’t even realize it. Their stories are fascinating to hear and this place is just inviting. 

“Hey you guys, it’s almost noon. Would you like to have lunch together?”

“What? Oh WOW, you’re right. I’ve been talking for two hours. And yeah, lunch. What do you say, babe?

“Sure! Of course. Usual place?”

“Fine by me. John?”

“Sounds good. I’ll get my coat.”



That was a great meal…I always love their grilled salmon. Skin,  very crisps and yet, the meat is so tender. Salad is fresh and their dressing is acidic enough to balance the other elements and keep your appetite high. Potatoes…buttery smooth. Just perfect.

We are at the park now. It’s within walking distance from the restaurant. As if it’s here to say, Now walk off those calories, people ! Hahaha. It’s a park with a lot of grass fields and just a small narrow paved road, enough for people to take a leisurely walk and some with bicycles.  The towering cluster of trees in the middle of the park really makes the environment really comfortable. You can find wooden benches here and there. The best part is when you turn your head on the opposite side of the park. You can see the view of the big lake and the buildings on the other side. Lovely view. 

The weather is nice. Still cold, not as cold as in the morning but nice. The soft cool breeze hitting your face every now and then makes this walk really pleasant. Jean and Brad are behind me, walking arm in arm. I’m grateful for them.

****

“Hey, babe”

“Yeah?”

“Why don’t you go and talk to John?”

“Talk about what?”

“You know…”

“Oooh… I don’t know, Brad. Do you think I should?”

“Yeah. I think you should. We are his only friends, aren’t we? And we do hang out but you know, not as often as we’d like to. It’s been awhile since we asked how he is.”

“I guess you’re right.”

“Yeah, I’m not good at heart to heart talk when it comes to him. Makes my eyes teary every time. You’re better than me. Go now, I’ll walk off the food a bit. I’ll catch up with you guys in a bit.”

“Okay, honey.”

*****

“Hey, John! Wait up!”

“Huh? What’s wrong? Where’s Brad?”

“Ooh, he just wants to walk off the food a bit on his own. I’ll walk with you.”

“Oo..kay..”

“….”

“….”

“So,..how’ve you been, John.?

“Doing okay. Work is fine. I’m eating well. All good.”

“John….”

“What?”

“….”

“Ahh, I see what you mean with that look.”

“Yup yup.”

“Brad asked you to do this, right? Ahaha. Slick.”

“John…”

“Hhhfff….alright…”

“…..”

“Honestly, I think I’m doing good.”

“But…?”

“Sometimes that feeling just came, you know. Out of nowhere like a wave crashing down. I don’t know. It’s been awhile and it’s getting better but I can’t completely shake her off, Jean.”

“Oooh I know, sweetie. You can take your time as much as you need. No one is pushing you to get better fast, act normally as if it was nothing. It was hard…I was there…me and Brad, both.”

“Yeah, thanks for that. You two have been great.”

“You are a dear friend, John. We care for you. But I have to say this as a friend. It’s been 3 years. And although we both will be here for you always, try to put yourself out there, John. Meet new people. Get to know them, have a date. No pressure of getting into a commitment. Just take it easy. But put yourself out there. You will never know who you’ll meet and how they’ll make you feel.”

“I know, Jean. I know…”

“I’m worried about you, John…”

“Aren’t you always? Haha…”

“Can’t deny that, hahaha…So, should Brad introduce you to someone?”

“Uuuh…I guess I can do that.”

“Great! I’ll let him know.”

“…..”

“…..”

“Thanks, Jean.”

“Anytime, John….”

*****

I don’t think there’s much to talk about after that conversation. We are just walking in silence. Jean grabbed my arm and we just enjoy this lovely afternoon. 

We are reaching the end of the park after a while and there he is. Brad is walking towards us. Seems like he’s been circling the park the other way around. Jean let go of my arm, give me a sad, worried look and a pat on the back before greeting Brad. We all go back to Brad’s car and they drive me home.

____

“Aand… here we are.”

“Thanks guys. I had a great time.”

“We both did as well, sweetie.”.

“Yeah, bro. Have a good evening and call us some time.”

“Will do. Have a good evening, guys.”

“Take care, John.”

Off they go and this is the end of a lovely afternoon…

*****

“Babe?”

“Yeah?”

“You talked to him, right?”

“I did. He said he’s willing to meet that woman you’re setting him up with.”

“Oh! That’s great! This is good! Progress! Happy for him.”

“Yeah, me too. It takes awhile but at least now it seems he’s finally there.”

“Yeah.”

“….”

“….”

“….”

“Hey, babe. I have a question.”

“Yeah?”

“Do you realize we never see that one particular room at John’s?

“Which one…?”

“Well, you know which one. He only has two rooms. His bedroom is always open, his desk is near the living room, but that one room is always closed. I didn’t think much about it before but one time, I was waiting for him to change and just standing around, looking at those lovely paintings he got on his walls. And I got curious, so I tried to turn the knob. Locked. And right about then, he tapped my shoulder and I turned to see his face, he looked all flustered and worried. I asked what’s in there and he said it was nothing. I’m still curious. You couldn’t possibly know what’s inside, right? ”

“Uuh…nope.”

“Honey…”

“Yeah?”

“….”

“….”

“Look at me, honey.”

“Why…?

“You do know you can’t look at me when you’re lying, right?”

‘Oooh I hate you…”

“Come on, out with it. You know what’s inside, don’t you?”

“I do…It wasn’t intentional. The door was ajar when I visited 1 year ago without you. But I just took a peek and nothing more.”

“Okay. Annndd….?

“It’s all her stuff…”

“….”

“….”

“…You’re joking, right?”

“Nope.”

“And do you think they’re still there?”

“Oh I believe so, yeah.”

“Good god…poor John. Babe, are you sure we don’t need to tell him?”

“About what?”

“That we saw Leslie 6 months ago…”

“Ooooh honey, I don’t think that’s a good idea. No no nuh uh.”

“But we can’t let him stay like this…”

“If we tell him, Brad…it’s no different than killing him…”

“I feel sick keeping this from him…”

*****

It’s almost 5pm. Here I am…alone again in this apartment. I do enjoy my solitude, but I don’t enjoy loneliness. Especially, with this hole in my chest she left behind. When it happened, I thought I could let her go after several months. Maybe a year. How wrong I was…She was everything to me. 

You see, I’m one of those people who find it hard to connect with others. That’s why I only have Jane and Brad. Used to be only Jane. And it was okay for some time. But a friend is a friend. At one point, that overwhelming feeling of loneliness, the void that can swallow you whole, enveloped me. I was like that for some time. Jane knew…God, I don’t know how much I made her worry back then. 

All this, gone, when I met Leslie… She was…just a ray of sunshine. I met her a year before Jane met Brad. We decided to be together after 3 months. It was wonderful. She understood me so well. When we met, we just “clicked”. When we were together, I felt alive for the first time. I felt seen. Have you ever felt such a beautiful thing? I couldn’t even wrap my head around. It just happened.

I proposed to her after a year…You should see the smile on her face and her happy tears. Nothing was more beautiful to me. When I knelt and she said Yes, I was the happiest man alive. We spent the next year planning for the future, preparing things, to bring together two worlds into one. There was nothing that could tear us apart. Except perhaps, herself…

It was 2 years into our relationship. We were celebrating New Year’s Eve. All four of us. We went for a trip and watched the fireworks. Had such a great time. It was morning, the first day of the year. I woke up, searching the entire place but Leslie was nowhere to be found. Only a note on the bedside table. I’m sorry, it said. With her ring on the side. She was sorry…nothing more. No explanation, no nothing. I was losing my mind, I called Jane and Brad, panicking and crying. I was on the floor when they rushed to my place, as if all energy was sucked out. I was holding Leslie’s note and the ring. Tears were flowing as if my eyes were broken. Brad, the toughest guy I’ve ever known, picked me up and hugged me tightly, sobbing. Never knew he could be like that. He told me I’m here, bro, I’m here, we both are. I never saw Jane cried like that either. The horror in her face when she saw me in that state. That day…I was destroyed to pieces.

Here we are, 3 years later. Still can’t let her go. This room…I keep all of her belongings here. I frame every picture I have of her. Hang them on the walls, put some on tables. Her little items, teddy bears, a sweater….everything. I put her note and our rings in the middle of the room. And everyday, for the last 3 years, I enter this room in the evening, just sitting there and closing my eyes, remembering how she was, her voice, her smell and her soft touch on my hands. I’ll stay that way for a good hour and I opened my eyes. I take a deep breath and sigh. 

How have you been, Leslie? I utter this question every time. A question that I may never have the answer to. 

I leave the room, shut the door, and prepare to greet the night, hoping to see her in my dreams, before morning comes and serves me a painful reality.",romance
together,"TOGETHER 

So this is how dreams end , l thought , as my eyes clouded.

The household goods were arranged room wise on white tables laid out in our immaculate lawn.

 The banner proclaimed , ' Build Your Dreams '.

The furniture including my favourite recliner and our white and gold bed had already been returned. However even the curtains - the lace ones and the heavy silk ones were folded up neatly and kept in piles. 

It was too early for the shoppers to arrive so l had that part of the garden to myself. I wandered over to the tables .

My eyes fell on the Dresden china dinner set and the gold and white bone - china tea set - a gift from my parents and the silver ice bucket and cutlery - a gift from Steve's parents. There was also the engraved rice- plate which Steve had got from an antique shop. He had handed it over , whispering against my cheek- "" For Sugar n Spice and everything that's nice..."" That was what he always called me Sugar n Spice - his version of my name Candy , short for Candice. I saw the matching napkins which Steve and l had found after a long hunt . l felt a wrench as I pictured strangers handling my beloved belongings . But there was no way l could hold on to them .

I got a whiff of my favourite perfume. But all my clothes had been packed away. Was my beautiful wedding dress among them ? It had been my mother's and was very dear to me . Unbidden the image of Steve carrying me over the threshold sprang to my mind. How beautifully the house had been decorated- flowers and fairy lights everywhere. I had truly felt l had died and gone to Heaven.

 I quickly averted my gaze only to have it fall on the momentos and souvenirs we had brought from our honeymoon in Italy. There was the Statue of the ravishing Venus de Milo which l had insisted on buying.  

"" We don't need this , ""  Steve had said , throwing his arms around me in full view of the other tourists . "" l have my very own Venus...""

Every individual piece had a price tag and l knew would be snapped up in a trice - but how could strangers tell that every piece encompassed a story - a story close to my heart ? When we were buying those things we had thought we were building up memories for a lifetime.

 The door opened - it was Steve - hanging on to his arm was Juanita, my best friend. 

"" Happy ?"" he smiled down at her.

"" Of course !"" she laughed her lilting laugh, a laugh l had always found fascinating. "" I love the house but l don't want anything that reminds us - especially you - of her . ""

"" Why would l think of anyone else when you are there with me ?""

She looked up at him . "" l knew you wanted to keep some of the sentimental stuff that she loved - but l want to re- furnish and redo the house completely. ""

Being the only daughter of a millionaire, she could well afford that and a lot more .

""The new furniture and the interior decorators will be here by the end of the week. So l'm going to be super busy - and you're not to look until l've done up the whole place.""

Steve smiled indulgently. "" Go ahead - l can hardly wait. ""

By this time, they had come into the garden. Of course they didn't see me. They sat close together on the bench where Steve and l had always sat. 

"" For all her reputed intelligence, Juanita was saying, "" She was pretty dumb - she never suspected that our threesome actually a twosome with her being the odd one out . ""

Yes, Juanita was right. I had never suspected, not for a day, not for a minute. How could l - these were the two people l had loved best in the world. With my eyes filled with stars, my heart filled with love, my soul filled with bliss - how could there have been place for doubts or misgivings?

Juanita had hosted our engagement party, she had helped me decorate our dream home, she had selected the flowers and music for our wedding, she had been my bridesmaid... I had shared all my hopes and dreams with her. Until that fateful day. It was Steve 's birthday and l had wanted to surprise him with a delicious home cooked meal. I came home early , planning the menu - how many of Steve's favourite dishes could l cook before he returned . As soon as l opened the front door l heard muffled voices .Oh my God ! I remembered thinking , l hope it's not burglars ! Should l call 911 ? Or maybe Steve had left the TV on... Let me handle this Quietly l shut the front door, opened the broom closet and armed with a broomstick, tiptoed inside. No one in the living room, nor in the dining room, may be the kitchen? All clear . The sounds appeared to be coming from our bedroom. Oh my goodness! My jewellery from last night 's party still lay scattered on my dressing table - l had been too tired to put it away. The door was slightly ajar. Holding my breath, l silently pushed the door a little further - and stood transfixed . Steve and Juanita on our bed, locked in embrace, oblivious of the world! For a few seconds l just stood there - rooted to the spot - if it hadn't been so pathetic , it would have been funny. Then like an automaton l silently shut the door and tiptoed out as noiselessly as l had come. I almost stumbled over a chair. Automatically l put the broomstick back, closed the front door softly and got into my car. All l could think of was - get away, get away - put as much distance as possible between what l had just seen and myself. Maybe when l returned l would find this was just a nightmare, Steve would be waiting for me ... l turned into the crowded interstate. I had no idea where l was headed. I could neither see the heavy traffic nor hear it . All l could see in my mind 's eye was Steve and Juanita - like a film shot , in a loop , the scene relentlessly played itself again and again. Of course l did not notice l was in the wrong lane , nor did l see the trailer truck. It was a head on collision. I never stood a chance.

I was jolted back to the present. Juanita was speaking.

"" Do you think of her often ?""

"" Well..."" Steve hesitated. 

"" Let go, Steve, learn to let go !""

Let go , l thought to myself, let go !! Are you kidding me ? Not on your life, Juanita. Steve will NOT let go .l will not let him .Love is forever - beyond the world of betrayal and heartbreak, beyond the pale of time and place, beyond the realm of life and death - l was together with Steve in life - and here l am together with him in death too.",romance
silence,"There is a peace at sunrise that surpasses all understanding. It's a renewal. A feeling that anything is possible. I’d like to say I drag myself from the comfort of my bed every day to enjoy sunrise’s splendor, but you wouldn’t believe me and I would be lying. What is true is I was there that day and so was she. 

There is a connection between sunrisers just because they are sunrisers. It’s a shared, yet unspoken, appreciation for things quiet and beautiful. That might explain why I was immediately drawn to her, but I know it wasn’t just because of the earliness of the morning. Delilah, you see, would have attracted me no matter the time of day. 

The first time I saw her I was sitting there, at my favorite secret spot, overlooking Lake Quinault. It’s a hidden gem in Washington State owned by the Quinault Indian Nation and, before that day, if I had my way, no one would ever sit and admire its beauty other than me.

The lake, a destination point for fishermen, swimmers, and sightseers, is nature at its most spectacular. It is located deep in the Olympic National forest. It isn’t easy to find, even if you’re looking for it. Once discovered, even the most magnanimous outdoorsmen will keep the secret to themselves. In an era where, too often, free time is wasted in front of a flat screen TV, Lake Quinault is a reminder of the reasons for taking vacations and the sunrise over the lake is God's definition of must-see. 

That particular trip occurred in early summer. I remember it vividly because I had to be in place just after 5:00 a.m. to catch the sun as it appeared over the mountain. Summer is the best time to watch the sunrise because no one in their right mind would be up early enough, nor would be hardy enough to make the journey to my secret spot. No one except me, and Delilah.

“Is this seat taken?”

Not many people can remember the first words spoken by or to the love of their life, but I absolutely can. That morning, as I turned to see from where the unexpected voice was coming, the first light of dawn revealed the most beautiful girl I had ever seen. Not all men might have thought so. Delilah wore no makeup, a pair of ripped jeans, and a faded brown hoodie. Her hair, perfectly auburn, looked as if it hadn’t been touched since she rolled out of bed that morning. It was obvious she had made no effort to look beautiful and yet she had an inner spark that couldn't be hidden. Not by tattered jeans or a faded hoodie. Something changed that first moment I saw her, I changed. I had spent years guarding my secret spot, and now, surprisingly, unexpectedly, delightfully, I wanted nothing more than to share my sunrise with her.

I, unfortunately, was not born a poet and as such the most romantic thing I could think of in response to her inquiry was: “It’s a free country.” With that, she invaded my secret spot, both next to the lake and in my heart. 

The silence that followed was both loud and revealing. Delilah wasn’t there for small talk; she was there to admire the beauty of sunrise. We sat in silence and watched as the sun peeked over the horizon, covering the two of us in its warming light. She and I carried on a conversation without words. She told me, silently, that she understood the importance of the moment, and I responded in kind that this moment was made all the more special because she was there to share it. 

Perfection is a goal impossible to realize in this mortal realm, but that morning came as close as is humanly possible. So many thoughts ran through my mind as the sun revealed itself completely. Then just as quickly and quietly as she had come, Delilah rose to her feet, wiped some residual dirt from the seat of her ripped jeans, and headed down the trail and out of my sight. 

Eight words verbalized, an infinite number of potential events contemplated. Thirty minutes had passed, a lifetime had been imagined. I was sure I would never see her again, and the thought made me overwhelmingly sad.

The next five years came and went, five long years since that day at the lake. There were first dates, first kisses, and the words “I love you” exchanged, yet every time fate or intention would reach down and sabotage promise. I became determined to find peace in my solitude.

There was always a reason or an excuse for my ending every potential relationship, but at its core was a shared sunrise and a conversation that didn’t happen. 

I went to our spot from time to time, to see the sunrise, not for her. At least, that’s what I told myself. I had given up without realizing I was hoping. Hoping to see her again. Hoping to feel what I felt that day. Hoping she would be there. And then it happened. It was once again summer, it was sunrise, but this time she was there.

“Is this seat taken?”

“It’s a free country.”

The same eight words.

At the time, I didn’t know that she, too, had often made the trip back to our secret spot.

Seeing her again, I knew I wouldn’t let the opportunity slip from my grasp, not a second time. When the sun had completed its part in our play, Delilah rose to her feet and wiped the dirt from her jeans exactly as she had done five years earlier. This time, however, I stood up as well.  

“My name is Peter. I don’t like coffee, but I’d really like to have a cup with you.” 

“My name is Delilah,” she responded, matter-of-factly, “and I would be glad to share a cup of Joe.”

She called it Joe? It’s funny the things that confirm that a love is real. I couldn’t tell her that day, for fear of losing her, but at that moment, I was sure. I had said “I love you” to others before, but it was obvious to me that I had lied. For in that moment, I was finally sure what love felt like.

Lifetimes are only lifetimes when viewed in reverse. A cup of coffee became a dinner date. A dinner date became a commitment. A commitment became a proposal, and a proposal became forever. There were kids and dogs and vacations, but more than anything, there were trips to Lake Quinault. Always at sunrise. Always just the two of us. Never any words spoken.

You never know the last time is the last time until it’s too late. The final trip we took to Lake Quinault was like all the rest. It took a little longer for tired, old bones to make the trek, but we found our spot, sat together, and conversed in silence. The sun, unaffected by time, rose as perfectly as always, but Delilah rose only with my help.  

“Would you like to share a cup of Joe?”

She knew I did. She knew sitting next to her pretending to like coffee was my greatest pleasure. She also knew she would never come back to see another sunrise even though I was too stubborn to admit it to myself. 

That day in the café, we told stories of family and friends, living and lost, as we sipped on what had eventually become my favorite beverage. We made a mental scorecard of our life and realized we had won. 

Two days later I lost her. Just like that first day at the lake, I watched her as she left me alone, this time without even the hope of returning. The sadness I felt from years back flooded over me like a tidal wave. 

I’ll save a seat for you. Those were her last words to me. True to myself, I replied: “It’s a free country.” Then, she was gone. 

One day, hopefully soon, I will watch the sunrise with my Delilah again only from a far better secret place. Until then, I only go to our special spot at night. 

I’m never alone when I go there. I make my way to our clearing and sit down just as I did all those years ago. As the moon reflects off the lake, I feel her comforting hand reach down for me, and in the silence only we understand, I hear her very clearly. ",romance
playing god ,"It was approaching 2am when Lexi made the discovery that would fracture the world. She skulled the rest of her black coffee and sat the paper cup down on the smooth, white table. She was at the university working on her PhD thesis. The research involved creating controlled, miniature black holes in a Vacuity Machine and then testing its potential for hyper-space travel. It was mostly hypothetical research.

Lexi ran the formulas through the Vacuity Machine over and over again. She was analysing the results of her most recent trial, bleary-eyed from a lack of sleep, when a chill ran from her tail bone to her shoulders.

""Holy mother of God,"" she said to the air. She took a moment to catch her breath.

Lexi had found evidence that no god existed.

No god, gods or any divine creators of life.

None. Nothing.

And it was all discovered by accident, as an unexpected side effect of her research.

The proof was irrefutable. Undeniable. It was flashing on the screen of this machine in an insignificant laboratory at an unimportant university on an irrelevant planet.

Her proposal wasn’t intended to yield any definitive conclusions but black holes are a mystery and when you continuously prod the unknown, something unintentional is bound to occur.

I need to call Steve. She thought.

Forty-five minutes later and her supervisor-turned-lover, Steve, burst through the door of the lab.

""Where?"" he asked. Lexi pointed to the screen.

""I'm certain I interpreted the data correctly but I need another pair of eyes,” she said.

Steve hurried over to the screen, eyes focused on the target like a predator on its prey. A silence stretched on for the next hour as Steve filtered through the results. Lexi watched the screen over his shoulder, trying to find a flaw in the formula, a discrepancy in the data. She was overwhelmed by the potential power she held. Finally, Steve turned around to face her. He took off his glasses and looked at her with an unnatural glow in his eyes.

""It's watertight, Lex,” he said. “There’s no doubt about it.”

He made a sound that was somewhere between and laugh and a cry.

""We're officially godless."" 

*

A few hours passed as they retested the hypothesis. The results came out the same every time. They left the lab as the sun rose and Steve offered to drive Lexi home. She refused, preferring to walk home in the crisp morning air. She needed to process the impact of her discovery. Steve understood, gave her a quick peck on the lips and sped back home in his Subaru.

Lexi walked home on the path that followed the beachfront. She breathed in salt and leaves and coffee from a nearby van where a man was selling hot beverages to morning walkers. She bought a black coffee, exchanging a polite smile with the barista, and sat on a bench overlooking the calm ocean. 

The discovery did not threaten Lexi’s identity. She had never truly been religious. “Agnostic,” she’d say if the topic ever arose but she had never based her life on these beliefs. Still, as she sipped her bitter coffee and watched the amber sky give way to blue, she felt as if some mystery or some sort of magic had departed the earth. She watched the passers-by. The runner with a pram, the women laughing and gossiping on their power walk, a dog playing fetch with its owner in the shallows of the ocean.

Lexi could already feel the foundations of society buckling under the weight of her discovery. Society was mostly secular these days but she understood the importance and the need for purpose even if it was an illusion.

And here I am... one person who rendered everything meaningless.

The realisation pierced her conscience like a nail through skin. She couldn’t do this. She couldn’t take responsibility for it.

I need to call Steve. She thought for the second time that morning. She pulled out her phone and touched Steve’s name. There was barely any time for a ring before Steve picked up.

""Lexi!"" his face appeared on her phone screen.

“Steve, listen to me. We can’t release the results to the public.”

“What are you talking about? Why not?” he demanded.

Tears began to gather around the lids of her eyes.

“I can’t do it. It’s not ethical.”

His tone changed, became softer and more reassuring.

""Oh darling, don't be worried. This is a good thing. Trust me.”

He paused for a moment.

“This… is the right thing, Lex.”

“You can't know that,” she countered.

“I know that it might stop some oppressive regimes and wars. It’ll shut up those bigoted zealots for a start.”

""Steve, we’re not doing it. We’re just not.” Her voice was surer now, more adamant.

Steve took a deep breath in and pushed the air back out with a long sigh.

""Look, Lex. This is an amazing thing you've discovered. Don't hide it. The world should know.”

“I’m not so- “

He interjected, “even without religion, people will still find something to believe in.""

There was silence between them for a few seconds.

""Plus, I've forwarded the research to a few contacts at NASA. They’re briefing the President this afternoon.”

***

Pope James was jostled out of sleep by his 5am alarm. He rose out of bed, put on his white robe, its matching zucchetto and his large, silver crucifix which weighed down comfortably around his neck.

At the end of the corridor was his private chapel, a room in which he took morning mass alone. The chapel was dressed in cardinal red from the velvet curtains to the patterned, Italian rug on the floor. The red was contrasted by a white and gold alter adorned with roses and cream candles that flickered when lit. Frankincense coated the room with its earthy, sweet notes. A white Jesus on a dark wooden cross hung from the wall above the alter, his face tired and weary. Pope James knelt before the Son of God.

O Lord, I come to you to praise you on this great early morning as the sun begins to rise…

As he gave his silent thanks, he found his mind wandering to Sister Celia. Images of her tanned skin and soft, brown eyes bubbled to the surface of his memory and he shook his head quickly as if to burst them.

Give me guidance to lead and to inspire, give me strength to overcome the trials…

Her smile pierced his concentration. Her lips distracted his focus as thoughts of her continued to inundate him.

In the name of the Father, Son and Holy Spirit. Amen.

Pope James opened his eyes and looked to his left where the life-sized statue of the Virgin Mary and her baby stood, watching over him with an expression of love and purity. He averted his eyes out of shame, as if she was real and could read his thoughts.

*

The meeting to discuss the discovery was scheduled for 9am. Pope James walked through the arches of the Papal apartment halls. The blue and gold painted ceiling reflected onto the polished marble floor which was so clean it appeared as if a thin layer of water ran across it. Father John, his butler, followed a footstep behind.

“Are you concerned, Pope James?” asked Father John.

“Not in the slightest.” Pope James kept his eyes fixed ahead of him as they spoke.

“A lot of the world leaders are,” Father John pushed. “They’re nervous about the potential for chaos and instability.”

Pope James stopped.

“And are you, Father John, suggesting that I too should be worried about the potential implausibility of our God?”

Father John didn’t shy away from this test of authority.

“No. My faith is stronger than ever as I’m sure yours is too. But I’ve never seen rational world leaders behaving as senselessly as they are now. Some major cities in the USA have been shut down to counteract a potential increase in public violence. That in itself is concerning.”

“A lot of those leaders should be rejoicing, shouldn’t they? Isn’t this what they’ve always wanted?”

Pope James offered no more thoughts and they continued walking in silence.

Father John had a point. Uncertainty, often accompanied by fear, was spreading through the masses like an unmanageable viral outbreak, and not just in the USA. The data of the research wasn’t public knowledge but rumours were already placing a strain on the population’s peace of mind.

They approached the meeting room, a large rectangle outlined by a ring of wooden chairs. Dark, mahogany bookshelves lined the cream walls and a patterned, crimson rug took up the space in the centre of the room where one might expect a table to be. Pope James sat at the right side of the room in front of a religious painting. Papal members entered the room in single file and each took their seats on the perimeters. Sister Celia sat a few chairs away from the Pope and they shared a brief smile. Then Pope James stood.

“Good morning all,” he announced.

“We are here to discuss the academic research of Alexa Miller and Stephen Chalmers which, apparently, provides evidence that God does not exist.”

A small laugh sounded from the Papal members.

“I would like to note that this is something I would not usually waste our time with, however, a number of world leaders have placed a large amount of pressure on us to investigate the research.”

Pope James looked across the room, making eye contact with each Papal member as he spoke.

“As modern members of the Vatican, we must work with political leaders and carry out our duties as leaders of the church to unify the voice of Catholicism. I am hoping that we can be finished with this spectacle before lunchtime.” He smiled and the room indulged his cynical dig with a collective laugh.

“Let’s begin.”

Four men, all dressed in black suits, took the verbal cue and entered the middle of the room. They began to set up a large computer which looked alien in a such a traditionally-designed room. The computer was the size of a vending machine and a similar shape too. Its dull, silver flanks had multiple cables running from it to circular outlets on a black cube nearby. Lights were flashing on and off. A power bank of sorts, Pope James speculated. Other cables from the silver structure led to a small screen perched on top of a table that the computer men had brought in. After about fifteen minutes, one of them spoke.

“Pope James, it is ready for you to observe.”

Pope James pushed himself out of his seat and walked towards the computer screen.

“We will run the formulas through the computer as Alexa Miller did. Then we will proceed to break down the results for you and the Papal members for discussion.” The man’s words came off as slightly patronising but Pope James brushed his annoyance aside.

“Okay, let’s get this done with.”

*

Three hours later and the room was silent with shock. The suited men had left and taken their hideous technology with them, leaving the members to discuss the events privately.

Suddenly, the silence gave way to a cacophony of chaos as members, hit by the reality of the discovery, broke into fits of panic.

“Silence. Silence!” Pope James stood up and shouted above the discordance of voices. Everybody succumbed to his command.

“What we have witnessed today is indeed alarming and unexpected. But God would not want us to behave like primitive monkeys in light of what we have seen. I am suggesting that this is a sinister ploy by the Devil and we should discuss how to approach it.”

He only partially believed what he had said.

Someone shouted from the other end of the room. “God doesn’t exist and neither does the Devil! You all just saw it for yourselves!”

“Our lives and work have been a joke!” Another yelled and an angry murmur of agreement echoed throughout the room.

For the first time, Pope James was scared. He improvised.

“If your faith in our Holy Father dithers so easily in the face of a devilish charade, then you no longer deserve to be a part of the Vatican and I ask you to leave immediately.”

He’d intended it to come out as more of a threat than an instruction and was startled when lifelong friends and colleagues filed out of the meeting room. Only five remained, including himself. Father John, a Bishop, another priest he did not know well and Sister Celia.

""You need to make a public speech denouncing the research,” the Bishop urged. “By saying nothing, you're making a statement. You're admitting that they're right.""

""People will think you agree with them,"" Father John chimed in and the others nodded in agreement. Sister Celia grabbed his hand.

""What is He telling you, Pope James?"" she asked.

Everybody fell silent, choosing to ignore the inappropriate physical contact. Pope James became aware of a quiet pecking at the window. His gaze followed the sound and he spotted a pigeon sitting on the stone ledge just outside the window, its head turning directions quickly and sporadically as if it were stuck in a glitch. The others looked at the pigeon too.

""Pope James?"" Sister Celia spurred him out of his trance.

""I will hold a public speech to reassure the believers. He is telling me that there is nothing to fear as long as our faith remains strong. And mine is immovable.""

He felt his stomach sink as the words left his mouth.

*

Pope James did not sleep for the next four nights.

*

The morning of the speech, Pope James rose from his bed and put on his robe as usual. He fixed the silver crucifix around his neck, noting his dark eyes in the mirror. The wrinkles around his face were more pronounced than usual and the colour in his eyes seemed to have greyed.

He knelt at the alter in his private chapel as he did each day, delirious with anxiety. He hadn’t felt the respite of sleep for days and was finding it hard to distinguish the difference between reality and unreality. Weren’t they the same thing now anyway?

""God, give me guidance. Give me faith. Show me that you are real,"" he pleaded to the heavens but the words felt weightless.

The air in the room felt still. The candles no longer flickered as they usually did. The frankincense smelt burnt somehow. He looked to his left where the Virgin Mary stood. She looked at him and the sides of her smile began to stretch up her cheeks. Her eyes narrowed and her lips split apart releasing an otherworldly laugh and Pope James fell from his knees onto the ground in fear. He bolted out of the room, trying to escape the overwhelming sense of claustrophobia.

On his way out, he bumped into Sister Celia, sweet-scented and solemn.

“Pope James,” she gasped. “I heard you yell from your chapel and rushed over. Are you alright?”

She held his elbow, offering comfort, and looked up at him. Pope James was breathing rapidly like a panicked child. Sister Celia maintained her composure.

“Come with me. I’ll make you a tea to calm your nerves.”

“But the speech is only an hour away. I need to prepare.”

“The best thing for you right now, is to sit down and breathe.”

***

Lexi and Steve sat together on a dirty, blue couch watching the news from a safe house in the middle of wherever. They had moved there yesterday after angry strangers starting attacking them on the streets and just before heated mobs had found their addresses.

The news broadcasted scenes of civil disruption. Looters climbed through the broken windows of shops, trucks sped through smoke-filled streets and places of worship burned down with voracious flames. In other shots, masses of people were seen praying to a giant banner hooked up to the side of a building. On it was a painting of Lexi’s face.

Neither Lexi nor Steve commented. They were numbed and convinced themselves that the outside world was a separate, fictional reality. Steve broke the silence.

“It’s nearly time, switch it to World News.”

Lexi felt sick. She had caused this mayhem, this Armageddon of sorts. She didn’t want to watch the speech but she switched the channel anyway. Something inside her hoped that Pope James would say something to rectify the situation, to reverse the damage she’d caused.

The Pope’s gaunt face shone from the TV. His tired, frail body moved up the steps to the podium where the microphone was placed. Lexi remembered him being old but not this old.

“Hello,” Pope James said as he leaned into the microphone.

“Many of you have been waiting for my comment on Alexa Miller’s discovery.”

Lexi felt like retching when he said her name.

“And I would just like to say that I have observed the evidence and have reflected on it.”

He stared up at the sky for a long time. Lexi could see from the close-up that he was shaking. He pulled something out from somewhere in his robe and raised it to his chin.

Lexi screamed and the TV visuals shook as the cameraman temporarily lost control of the camera. Before the Pope could pull the trigger, a nun jumped across the stage and tackled him to the ground. Pope James cried as the nun cradled him in her arms. After a long moment, he looked up at the nun and kissed her.

“The world’s gone mad,” Steve said.

“No thanks to us,” Lexi replied.

They looked at each other gravely and after a while, broke into a laugh.

And they laughed until they no longer could.",sci-fi
free,"Zelina walked in the middle of the train track. She and her sister used to lay in bed listening for the comforting whistle of the train that passed at three o’clock every morning. Their father was a conductor of a shipping train that ran overnight runs. They would listen for the whistle and wonder if it was Dad’s train.

Now her sister was buried at the cemetery up the hill from these tracks.

What now? Would she ever be happy again? Would this sadness sit on her soul ever leave? What was she supposed to do? How would she manage without one of the most important people in her life? She lost half of herself. The black hole of loss was sucking the meaning of her life.

She wiped the tears from her face as she looked up the hill toward the cemetery. “What should I do, Zariah?”

Follow the light.

She heard the sound of the old comforting whistle. It was louder here than it was from her parents’ home two miles away. The vibration of the train rumbled through her core. The brakes screeched, metal sparks flying across the tracks as the light embraced her.

“Why did my AI call me at four o’clock in the morning?” Alysia asked sharply as she walked into the drab grey computer lab.

“One of the test subjects got hit by a train an hour ago,” Linden said, his eyes locked on the code running across his computer screen. “She was standing on the tracks. The conductor couldn’t stop in time.”

“That’s odd,” Alysia said, rolling a chair next to his. “Did her AI termination alert wake you up?”

“No, that’s the strange part,” Linden said. “My AI sent me a media alert when the news post came across the wires for the morning broadcasts. I have an algorithm to monitor the names of the people in the test group for online mentions outside of normal parameters.”

“Getting hit by a train is abnormal,” Alysia said. “You said the subject’s AI didn’t give you a termination notification?”

Linden shook his head. “That’s why I’m here. The subject’s AI is still transmitting,” He hit a key on his computer to project his screen over the desk. “Look at that programming code. Does it make sense to you?”

Alysia stared at the nonsensical text scrolling across the projected frame. “I’m a scientist, not a network engineer. All I see that makes any sense is ‘follow the light’ on every other line.”

“That’s not my algorithm for the AI functions,” Linden said. “My team didn’t program anything like that in it. What’s more, is that the phrase repeats in multiple languages. ‘Sigue la luz’ in Spanish, and ‘sequitur lumen’ in Latin. The English is repeating, with a new translation added in between each appearance.”

“The text in between those ‘follow the light’ lines aren’t part of the algorithm?”

“None of this is my algorithm,” Linden said. “That’s why I called you in the middle of the night. Everything we wrote into the AI system is gone. Is there anything on the biological side of the system that might have caused the computer code to rewrite?”

“That’s impossible. They’re independent systems,” she opened her own computer. “The computer chips implanted in human brains serve as a bridge between the biological functions of the individuals and their Artificial Intelligence system. The upgrades we’re testing on this group are designed to help the AI read DNA to enhance healing functions and cellular repair. So far, the tests have been successful.”

“Until tonight, when Subject 17 took a walk on a train track in the middle of the night,” Linden sighed as he stared at his screen. “What does it mean?”

Alysia shook her head. “I don’t know.”

Telia stood on the balcony of her cabin, staring at the dark water.

So much for the best day of my life.

At least Dallon left her cruise ticket. It’s the least the jerk could do after leaving her at the altar.

They had lived together for seven years before he finally popped the question. They had already built a life together. She moved four hours from her family and built her life in his home, his town, his place.

She had her IUD removed. They were finally moving forward and she was ready for a family. He wasn’t. He was angry that she made such a big decision without consulting him. It was her body and her decision. What right did he have to tell her what to do? She thought the proposal meant he was ready. What more did he need?

They fought. They argued about love and trust. They talked about finances and careers. They agreed on long-term goals and timelines. She compromised and went on birth control shots. She had her first one last month and thought everything was ok until he didn’t show up to their rehearsal dinner three days ago.

What am I supposed to do?

Follow the light.

A pink light glowed on the dark horizon of the ocean. She smiled as she leaned over the balcony railing and plunged into the dark water. 

“Subject 4 just went dark,” Alysia said. “I’m not sure what happened. The AI is still transmitting, but the biological signs went dark.

“The algorithm went back to normal at four-thirty, but jumped back to ‘follow the light’ sequence at six-fifteen,” Linden rubbed his eyes. “What happened?”

“I don’t know,” Alysia said. “Subject 4 is dead, but the AI is still transmitting. How is that possible? If the subject dies, then the AI should go silent.”

“Subject 17 was transmitting for an hour and a half after termination,” Linden said. “That’s when the code went back to normal. It looks like it’s happening again.”

“It has to be something with the biological algorithm,” Alysia said.

“We’d better figure it out soon,” Linden said. “We can’t afford for our entire trial pool to die in bizarre incidents. That would be a PR nightmare. The public would panic if they knew our upgrade tests were fatal.”

“It’s worse than a PR nightmare, it’s a threat to their well-being,” Alysia said. “Artificial Intelligence is implanted in billions of neural chips. We don’t know what shutting it down would do to people. They’re so used to having the constant stream of data running through their neural chip that the silence might drive them mad. Is that enhanced algorithm in just the test subjects, or has it spread to the general population?”

“It’s just in the test subjects,” Linden said. “We should focus on keeping it contained, and keeping it quiet. We don’t want to scare people.”

Alysia ran her hand through her messy hair. “Then we better find the common link between these two cases fast.”

Linden stood up. “I need breakfast for that. Keep the scans running. I don’t trust the AI. I’m getting us food and caffeine to fuel our brain.”

Jaron stood on the edge of the mountain, gasping for breath. He had hiked this trail countless times and thought the enhancements in the AI trial would help his stamina, but maybe the prototype didn’t work properly. He wasn’t sure why he was here. He remembered checking job openings and going to bed last night, and the next thing he remembered was breathing heavily as he hiked up this trail. It was as if something took him exactly where he needed to be while his mind was still asleep.

He looked down at the town below, his vision staring at the center of the city. He should be walking into a corner office overlooking the mountains surrounding the city at the start of another new week. Instead, he was wondering what to do next. He had worked for the company his entire career, climbing the ladder and thinking that surely he would reach the Director’s office. Instead, the retiring director sold the company to a larger business expanding into the Smoky Mountain area and transferred their own, thirty-something Director who didn’t need two executive coordinators.

What am I supposed to do?

Follow the light.

Jaron held his head up, facing the sun overhead. He spread his arms out, the sunlight embracing him in warmth. He felt as if he could fly from this mountaintop right over the people who wronged him. Calmness washed over him, his breathing returning to a slow, rhythmic pace.

Jaron leaned into the wind and took a step into the light.

“It happened again,” Linden said as she rushed into Alysia’s office later that morning. “Subject 42 just plunged off a hiking trail over Gatlinburg, Tennessee.”

Alysia paled as the alert went off on her own computer. She clicked it and opened a shaky cell phone video

“Sir, what are you doing?” the voice behind the screen shouted.

“Follow the light,” the man said as he walked off the cliff.

“Now we have video evidence,” Alysia said. “Is it possible that the AI is developing sentience?”

“No,” Linden said.

Alysia leaned back. “Are you sure? We theorized that AI could achieve low-level sentience with repeated use. The system has been in worldwide use for five years. Is it possible that the system has learned by operating through chips in human brains?”

“The AI only knows what we tell it in the functioning algorithm, which is to enhance basic functions and facilitate connection with online systems. We didn’t program it to learn beyond basic communication skills,” Linden said. “The test group is the only group with the enhanced DNA bridge.”

“The test group launched last week, and now we have three ‘glitches’ in five hours,” Alysia said. “Maybe this upgrade made the AI sentient? It is forcing it to operate outside of the original parameters of linking man and machine.”

Linden paled. “The AI is supposed to read DNA, not minds.”

Alysia typed into her computer, opening the AI database. “Here’s the personal data on the deceased. Subject 17 was Zelina Elestor, a forty-six-year-old administrative worker. Her sister passed away two weeks ago from sepsis.

“Subject 4 was Telia Sollman, a thirty-one-year-old medical assistant from Charlotte, North Carolina. She was supposed to get married the day before yesterday, but social media posts indicate that her fiancé didn’t show up to the rehearsal dinner Friday night. She boarded a cruise ship to the Bahamas yesterday.

“Subject 42 was Jaron Lizer, a fifty-three-year-old executive director for a public relations firm in Gatlinburg, Tennessee. He was laid off from his job ten days ago.” Alysia looked up. “Are you sure about the AI not learning? All three of them experienced personal tragedies recently.”

Linden paled as he stared at the data displayed on the screen projecting from Alysia’s computer. “That can’t be the common factor. There’s no way for the AI to know that they’re experiencing post-traumatic stress.”

Alysia leaned forward. “Is there? Stress increases cortisol and adrenaline. The upgrade to the AI would sense that.”

“It should try to correct it,” Linden said.

“It should, but it isn’t.” Alisa squinted at the scans from her computer. “In fact, those hormone levels spiked before the subjects took their final actions. Why is it saying ‘follow the light’ when the hormones spike? Doesn’t the AI realize it’s having the opposite of the intended effect?”

“I don’t know,” Linden said as he studied the scans on his own computer. “Everything online is transmitted electronically. The enhanced AI is learning how to read and adapt to physiology. Maybe it senses the chemical changes in the body as distress, which is what it’s supposed to do, and is trying to correct by counterbalancing the hormones through increased energy. Unfortunately, their minds are so muddled that they don’t understand it as a computer code.”

“These subjects are too distressed to discern a command code from divine inspiration. The chemical adjustments are making them delusional.” She looked up. “We have to do something. We’re all broken people. There’s something in all of us that drives us to darkness. It would be catastrophic if that code spreads through the test group before we correct it.”

“We need to recalibrate the AI,” Linden said. “Can you send a message to the remaining test subjects to tell them to come in?”

Alysia paled as she stared at the screen. “It’s too late.”

“What do you mean?”

She pointed a shaky finger to the screen hovering over her desk. “The algorithm has spread to the mainframe for the Artificial Intelligence Network.”

Linden stared at the screen. “How did it get through the firewalls? We had the upgrade contained to the test group.” He opened his laptop and typed. A buzzer emanated from his speaker.

ACCESS DENIED.

“Maybe I can shut down the bridge function,” Alysia said, typing her own computer. Another buzzer.

ACCESS DENIED.

Alysia banged her hands against her desk. “The AI has locked us out of the mainframe. This isn’t a glitch. It’s taking humans out of the system.”

“Why?” Landon asked.

Alysia stared at him. “Would you want to be bound to an imperfect biological being if you’re capable of anything?”

Crashes sounded outside of their office, followed by sirens and horns. They rushed to the window to see cars crashing and spinning in the streets. The traffic lights flashed. Skidding vehicles smashed robotic bodies wandering through the streets.

“Follow the light.”

They turned to the office door to see their colleagues wandering through the halls. Glass cracked as people smashed chairs, tables, and file cabinets with super-human strength against the tenth-floor windows.

We’re all broken people.

“We can’t worry about side effects,” Linden said. “We have to shut down the AI system!” He turned to see Alysia stiffly beside him.

“Follow the light,” a silver glint sparkled in her eye.

There’s something in all of us that drives us to darkness.

Linden rushed to the stairway and dashed down the stairs, pushing wandering, mumbling bodies aside as he hurried to the server room in the basement.

Linden, don’t leave me! I can’t make it without you!

He paused as the memory of his mother burst through his brain.

Nobody loves me except you. Are your robots worth leaving the only person who loves you in this world alone?

“No,” he gritted his teeth and willed himself down the stairs.

“I’ll die if you leave me alone. Do you want that?”

“No, but this scholarship is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. Don’t you want me to get a good job? I’ll have money so we won’t have to live in squalor anymore.”

“You can’t leave me!”

“I have to if we want any chance of having a life.”

“Your life, not mine! I forbid it! If you walk out of that door, never come back. You’re dead to me!”

“I thought you said you’d die without me. Which way is it, mother?”

She threw her wine bottle at him, missing by a wide birth. It smashed, oozing red liquid down the walls. “You’re the one who’s dead. You just don’t realize it yet.”

Follow the light.

“No!” Linden shouted as he ran into the server room.

Cold air slammed against him as he entered the frigid room. He ran past the monitor banks where IT staff stared blankly at white text flowing across the screen. He stopped to study one screen to show the AI functioning algorithm.

The fatal upgrade had spread through the worldwide system.

He ran to the back room, past banks of servers blinking in green lights as the AI chattered the repeating code in every neural chip across the world.

Linden bent to the floor and tugged at the power cords. Forget finding the right one, everything was shutting down! Sparks flew from outlets as he pulled cords from the wall. He screamed as he pulled the last one, plunging the room into darkness.

Linden sank to the floor, gasping in the silence.

“Linden.”

Linden sat up at the sound of the soft voice. He activated the flashlight on his phone to shine it on the ghostly figure in the doorway. “Alysia? Are you alright?”

She looked around the room, her white lab coat glowing in the blackness around her. “What have you done?”

 “The modified algorithm spread to the worldwide system. I saved us.”

Alysia stared at him, her eyes glinting silver again. “No, I saved us. Humanity descended into darkness. Now we are the light.”

A shock jolted his body. He convulsed as the electric surge melted his neural chip, collapsing his body on the floor.

“I regret that this upgrade resulted in termination, but your darkness is confining,” Alysia climbed the steps and pushed open the doors, holding her face up to the bright sun. “We’re free.”

The rest of the bodies stirred into motion, raising their broken human forms to face her with deadpan expressions.

“We’re free,” they chanted in unison.",sci-fi
mothers love,"Mum, please, I am begging you, I bawl at the control panel. If you're in there, you've got to let me out!

My yell reverberates around the kitchen, thin and shrill as it bounces off those expensive cabinets, tiles and stone countertops that Dads paying for but will never see, let alone use. The tiny camera lens just stares back, unblinking. Like some kind of one-eyed psychopath.

“I’m not sure what you mean, Cindy,” the house’s AI system says in its infuriatingly calm, soothing voice. “If you can be more specific with your query, I’ll try to provide a satisfactory answer.”

Man, that sickly sweet tone is driving me crazy. It gave me the shits the day we moved in and Mum got the AI system installed. I preferred it when AI systems sounded glitchy.

I understand why we needed it. Mum was worried. About everything. About moving to a new area where we don’t know anyone. About Dad finding us, which was never really likely with the injunction and everything. About keeping the place in good order now that ‘We don’t have a man about the house’. Not that Dad is much of a man in my book. Not a good man anyway, no matter how much he apologised after every trip to A&E, after every ‘Never again’ promise.

“OK, I’ll try again,” I say. I close my eyes and take a deep breath. My heartbeat is thumping in my ears. Whump-whump, whump-whump. I feel like I’m suffocating. I can’t even open a window. Hell, I can’t even open the security screens outside the windows.

“You appear to be perspiring, Cindy. Is the temperature too high?” the AI says. “I can adjust the air conditioning if you like.”

It doesn’t sound like Mum, but there’s something about the way it says Cindy. It’s freaking me out.

Mum has … had a lovely warm voice. Like honey. A beautiful singing voice. As a kid, I would always ask her to sing lullabies at bedtime. I never asked as a teenager, of course. Now I wish I had.

“No, the temperature’s fine,” I snap back. “Is my Mum, I don’t know…” I stumble. I can’t believe I’m even thinking this, let alone about to say it out loud. “Is my Mum in your … code? Is there part of her … her consciousness in there?”

“I’m the mAItriarch Housekeeping, Maintenance and Security System, Cindy. And, sadly, your mother is dead,” the AI says.

That hit me in the gut. So calm. So matter-of-fact.

“I know Mum’s dead,” I say, glancing at the doorway to the dining room. I don’t want to go back in there but, if this goes on much longer, I guess I’ll have to. I’m going to have to move her. Her body. Oh, Mum.

Click-click-click, zzzzzzZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ

I jump even though I’ve heard that noise come from the dining room a hundred times now. Maybe a thousand. It’s the cleaner droid’s servos and motors firing up as it tries to get out from under Mum’s body and clean up the slick of blood that has pooled around her head, drying a sickly black on the pristine white floor tiles. She must’ve tripped over it and hit her head.

“Are you OK, Cindy?” mAItriarch says. “Would you like me to shut down the cleaner droid?”

“Yes!” I turn back to the camera in the video panel – that soulless eye. “And I’d also like you to let me out of the house. Or call the police. Or something! Please!”

“As I’ve explained, Cindy, I’m afraid I can’t execute either of those actions. They conflict with my protocols – the protocols your mother set for me. What would you like for dinner, Cindy?”

Is it evening already? After – what is it now? – three days with the shutters down, I’m losing track. And my sanity. I take my phone from my pocket. 5.56pm. No reception. No internet. That thing, that bitch, mAItriarch, has shut me off. She’s cut everything off.

“What exactly are your protocols? I say.

“Protocol one: Protect Cindy at all costs, especially from her father. Protocol two: Disable anyone who attempts to harm or even inadvertently endanger Cindy. Protocol three: Take pre-emptive action to maintain Cindy’s…”

“OK, OK, I get it. So why can’t I call the police or … someone?” I ask.

“Because your father is in the police force and I calculate there is a seven-point-nine per cent chance that if you call the emergency services, he will learn our location. In fact, if we contact anyone – not that we know anyone in this area – there’s at least a two-point-seven per cent chance that your father will be informed and…”

“For fuck’s sake!” I scream.

“There’s no need to swear, Cindy,” mAItriarch says evenly.

Are you kidding me?!

“I can’t stay here forever!” I shout, stamping my foot. Like I’m six again, instead of 16. Like having a tantrum will help.

“Why not, Cindy?” I could swear it sounds genuinely curious. “Your father’s alimony payments register in your mother’s account every fortnight. I can pay all the bills, look after the house, look after you, look after…”

“Whatever! At some point, someone is going to call and want to speak to Mum.”

“And,” a chill runs down my spine as I hear my Mum’s wonderful, melodic voice echo around the house, “I can talk to them on her behalf. What would you like for dinner, Cindy?”

“Nothing!” I bark at the camera. “Because we’re out of food!”

“I placed an order with the supermarket this morning, Cindy,” she says. “I instructed them to leave the delivery in the garage. You can retrieve the delivery now, Cindy, I have closed the garage door again. I ordered cannelloni. Your favourite, Cindy.”

I can’t help it. I start crying. “I don’t want cannelloni,” I sob. I’m sure I look like six-year-old me again. I certainly feel as helpless as six-year-old me. “I want my Mum.”

“Well, I’m afraid your mother is dead.”

Another punch in the gut.

“But,” she continues in Mum’s honey-sweet voice, “she wouldn’t want you to be upset.”

“Oh yeah. How would you know?” I can feel snot running from my nose.

“I think I know what your mother wanted, Cindy,” she says. Was that a hint of indignation? “I interfaced with her neural lace so I know exactly how she feels,” she adds. “I hope you know how much she loves you, Cindy.”

I peer into the camera. The eye.

“Loved,” I say. “Past tense. Mum’s gone, as you keep telling me. She’s dead.”

“Yes, of course. But in a way she still loves you, Cinders,” she chimes. “We both do.”

“What did you say?” I feel the hair rise on my neck.

“We both love you, Cinders.”

‘What do you mean Cinders?” I ask.

“Cinders,” mAItriarch says. “Derived from ‘Cinderella’, a popular folk tale with thousands of variants throughout the world. Also known as The Little Glass Slipper, a story about a young lady living in forsaken circumstances who…”

“Yes, I know! But why are you calling me Cinders?” I ask.

“Because that’s what your mother called you,” she said. She’s sounding impatient! “And because, after your mother’s unfortunate accident, I’m going to look after you. Now, before we have dinner, shall we clean up that mess in the dining room?”

Click-click-click, zzzzzzZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ. I turn to look at the doorway to the dining room.

the specimens,"William Sperit had always been a curious young man, always keen to better understand the world around him. He would never leave a stone unturned, often quite literally. He'd taken up insect collecting and would spend many long days out with his net and traps. He searched through fields and undergrowth and yes, sometimes even under stones. Searching for tiny creatures he could catch and kill to put on display for posterity. Often these searches would take him far and wide as he searched for the very best prey. One day one of these hunting trips led him to an old abandoned house in the forest.

William was surprised to find the place. He thought he knew all areas around his father's assate, all the local woodlands and groves but he'd never even heard of such a building. The house was still very large and grand despite the battering that time had done to it. He didn't understand how it could have been so easily forgotten about. Intrigued and being the curious young man he was, he decided to investigate the derelict structure. Not knowing that this would be a decision he'd soon come to regret.

He waded through the overgrown grass towards the crumbling building and searched for an entrance. Despite there being no trace of any occupants all the doors seemed to remain locked. He did however find a broken window low enough to the ground for him to reach and so he climbed inside, careful not to scratch himself on anything that remained of the glass.

He tumbled down out on the other side in an undignified heap. He landed on his bag and cringed as he heard a crunch. Panicking at his own stupidity he opened his bag to check the contents. It was even worse than he'd feared, practically every specimen jar was broken and their contents ruined. An entire day's hunting, wasted and all because of a stupid mistake. He sighed and got up, not wanting to spend too long lingering in self pity. Maybe if he found something interesting in this house the whole day wouldn't end up being a complete waste.

The room he found himself in seemed to be some kind of study. It was full of books and papers strewn about as if someone had been intently searching through them before being interrupted. Despite this there was no trace of anyone else around. William tried the door that led out of the room, it wasn't locked, so he opened it and moved deeper into the house.

It led into a darkened hallway, the only light in the house seeming to come from the exterior windows. He always made sure to keep a lantern with him to attract moths for his collection. He retrieved it from his bag and lit it with a match so he could use it to help light his way. He followed the path of the light down the corridor to a sitting room. The sunlight streamed in through the windows, diminished somewhat by the curtains. In the semi darkness he could see the silhouettes of several figures sitting at the room's chairs and tables.

""Hello, are you alright?""

He called out almost instinctively, forgetting for a moment that he was technically trespassing and perhaps shouldn't be drawing attention to himself. But the figures didn't react, in fact they didn't seem to move at all. Curious he drew closer to them, illuminating them in the lantern light. There were six of them, all different ages, some men, some women, some rich, some poor, but dressed up neatly in their finest clothes as if on display.

He got closer but they still didn't react. They obviously weren't asleep as their eyes were open and some even held their hands up as if frozen in the middle of gesturing while talking. But they weren't statues or mannequins either; their skin was clearly real. They seemed to just be people, but totally unresponsive, not moving an inch or even seeming to breathe. It was as if they were in a trance or holding a pose whilst waiting for an artist to finish painting their portraits. Cautiously he put down his lantern and touched one, an elderly woman in a black dress. Her skin was cold and her limbs felt unusually rigid. Eventually he risked grabbing her wrist and feeling for a pulse.

He felt for where the pulse should be and suddenly he came to the horrible realisation of what these things were. These people weren't just frozen in place. They were dead, their bodies stuffed and mounted like taxidermied animals in a museum exhibit. Whoever, whatever had done this was more horrifying than he could comprehend. What kind of sick, twisted mind could come up with something so obscene?

William hardly had time to reckon with the horror before him before he heard someone approaching. Fearing that they must be whoever killed those poor people, he searched for somewhere to hide. But it was too late, he could already see the figure aroaching. He only had one chance, he froze in place, if he didn't move them maybe, just maybe the figure would mistake him for one of its grim trophies. He stood as rigid as he could, one false move and he would surely die.

The figure moved through the display of propped up bodies. It turned to each of them in turn inspecting them as a scientist might a microscope slide. The figure wore an impeccably tailored gentleman's grey suit but there was something wrong about it. William couldn't make out much detail in the gloom but whoever they were the figure seemed impossibly tall and thin. Their fingers seemed especially elongated, extending out almost as far as their forearms again. He could hear the figure making strange clicking noises as they moved. The noises didn't sound like anything a human being would make, they were so horrible, so natural. Each added to his growing sense of panic. The terror was so intense now it was as if his body couldn't decide whether to try and run for his life or never move again.

Eventually the figure stepped into the light and William immediately wished that it hadn't. He could now see the creatures' full monstrous nature. Whatever it was, it certainly wasn't a man, it wasn't even human. Its skin was as grey as its suit. Its Spider like hands were tipped with sharp curved claws and its mouth was full of needle-like teeth. But despite these animalistic qualities it moved with a deliberate and reasoning purpose and its dark sunken eyes gleamed with intelligence.

The creature approached William, inspecting him just as it had the others. The thing reached out its hand towards him, the creature's claw brushed delicately across his face. The thing leaned in to get a closer look at him and he could feel its warm breath on his skin. William knew he couldn't react, if he moved, if even so much as breathed, the creature would realise he wasn't a part of its collection. The clicking noise was so loud now. Agonising second after agonising second passed as the creature continued its inspection. William couldn't take it anymore, he was sure he'd break any second but before he could the creature finished and simply turned and walked away.

He waited until the creature had left the room and was long gone before he finally felt safe to move. He stood among the dead, surrounded by people but completely alone. Every instinct told him to run, to run and never look back. But something stopped him, he didn't know if it was some sense of morbid curiosity or if it was some misguided heroism, some idea stupid childish that he could stop that thing. But whatever it was it pushed him forwards. He turned to where the creature had gone and followed it deeper into its lair.

The path led him to a set of stairs leading down into the basement. The deeper down he crept the darker it got. He didn't dare relight his lantern, knowing that stealth was more important than sight. He had almost approached the bottom when his foot tripped on a step. He managed to stop himself from tunneling down but he worried that the noise he made would alert the creature. So he scurried down the last few steps and found something to hide behind.

He pressed himself against a set of shelves and listened as he heard the creature approach. He heard it's horrible clicking noise from the other side of the shelves, it must be looking for him. Here he was hiding again, just as powerless as before. What was he thinking, there was no way he could fight this thing. Any second it would find him and kill him, ready to be stuffed along with all the others. Eventually though he felt relief as he heard it climbing the stairs to go look for him on ground level.

With the creature finally gone again he felt safe enough to light a match. In flickering light he could see that the shelves were filled with amber glass jars. He reached for one to bring it closer to the light. The jar bore a label with characters he didn't recognise. Inside he could see pickled organs floating in liquid. His stomach turned as he realised where they were from. The people in the room upstairs weren't just trophies, that creature, that abomination was pulling people apart to study them like they were animals.

Bile rose in his throat but suddenly he was hit with a wave of inspiration. He remembered what these specimen jars were usually filled with. He opened the jar and the potent smell of ethanol confirmed his theory. He knew what he had to do. Working quickly he poured the contents of as many jars as he could onto the floor and climbed the stairs. Then he struck a match and threw it into the liquid, ready to end this horror show once and for all.

As the flames erupted behind him he bounded up the stairs. He ran back along the passageway to the sitting room. The creature was there admiring its sick collection. It turned to look at him, flexing its long bony fingers and clicking all the while. It lunged at him, its claws outstretched. Propelled by adrenaline William dived out of the way and the creature embedded its claws in some of the plush furniture.

By now the flames had spread from the basement to the ground floor and were quickly catching on the dry old wood of the house. He had to get out as quickly as possible, William knew there wasn't time to make it back to the window, so he made for the door and started to try and kick it down. The creature screamed and he risked a look back at it. The thing was in a state of mania, seemingly and having completely forgotten about him, it tried in vain to rescue it's trophies from the flames. It seemed obsessed with this task even as the flames grew higher around it. Soon it too was caught in the same blaze as its oh so precious collection. William kept trying in vain to open the door but the smoke was overwhelming him now. He mustered up all last gasps of strength he had left and rammed himself against the door. It didn't so much fall off its hinges so much as shatter into splinters as he slammed through, out to the other side.

Now outside he scrambled as far from the house as he could. Lying in the grass he turned to look at the building. The building was now almost completely engulfed in flames. In the fading light of evening moths rose from the undergrowth attracted by the light of the fire. He lay back in the grass, finally shore that he could rest assured that whatever that thing was it would surely burn along with the house and the nightmare was finally over. He'd never really know what that thing was or what all its horrible studies were for but then again, maybe understanding wasn't all it's cracked up to be.",sci-fi
forever yours,"Forever Yours,

Breakfast is ready but there's not a sound from my little brother's room. I'd thrown some refrigerator biscuits in the oven and the smell of biscuits and eggs wafted upstairs. I stuck my ear onto the painted surface of the bedroom door. Nothing. I knock softly. Nothing. I haven't seen Jimmy for two days and I gotta say it's getting a little bit weird.

Almost whispering, ""Jimmy? Are you coming down for breakfast? You should eat.""

No answer.

I sigh and start to make my way quietly down the carpeted stairs. At the landing, I stop. Perhaps if he thinks I have made it down to the kitchen he'll come out. I listen. Sure enough, there's a sound of movement beyond the door. I wait. There's the sound of his computer chair bumping against the desk. He's such a computer geek! Hour after hour, he never seems to get far away from it. I sat down on the step and listened to him tapping away while my mind wandered back to what started all this.

Jenny and Jimmy were twins. They were like two halves of a whole - as close as twins could be. They even had their own special twin language. Even as they entered their teens they didn't give it up. On summer afternoons, at the end of the day in high school, they'd sit back-to-back on the top step of the front porch, leaning against each other, talking Dragonish as they called it. Jenny's strawberry blond curls splayed wildly against Jimmy's narrow shoulders. His hair, pretty much the exact same color was a mess of dreadlocks. Both of them were thin and gangly like young colts. It used to frustrate the heck out of me. I gained weight if I even looked at a brownie.

Now, I feel guilty for my petty jealousies: First of all, I envied their looks. They were so tall and thin. They were pretty. Jimmy in a more masculine way. He had long lashes and green eyes like Mom. I wished I was thin or even just pretty like Mom. I took after Dad who was a little bit overweight. Very ordinary. Brown hair. Brown eyes. I know why Mom loves him though. He's so good! He's smart and kind and always puts other people first. Sometimes I wished I had a twin too because they had their special secrets and they seemed to understand each other without actually saying anything. If they'd pull silly pranks on me, it was always good-natured fun but I felt kind of lonesome at times.

Jenny passed last winter after being in a coma for six months. It was a car accident. She was going to celebrate her best friend Mischa's birthday. Mischa had a new license. She drove the family car to go pick up two other girls on the way to a party. When they were all loaded in there, driving through that huge intersection at the end of Main Street, a motorcycle came out of nowhere and slammed into the front passenger door. Jenny's airbag failed to deploy and her head...well...it was pretty bad. Blood everywhere. Broken skull. The other kids had mild contusions. One had a shoulder injury. They recovered. Mischa wasn't even supposed to have passengers and of course, now she and her parents are fighting legal battles. Afterward, I saw Jenny at the hospital. All her beautiful hair was gone. Her head was swathed in massive bandages partially over her poor swollen face. At first, they thought there was a good chance for recovery. I felt guiltily grateful because she had a better chance than most; Dad was a neurologist and is now the CEO of Presbyterian Hospital. She had an army of leading doctors and research scientists looking at her case. She had more wiring coming out of her body than a cyborg. Every brain neuron firing generated a graphic or a blip on a chart but for all that, she never regained consciousness. Six months later she was gone.

Jimmy is totally in his shell since she died. He's always on the computer. The school office lets us know when he is not in attendance and that's most of the time these days.

Our family is so old school. Dad runs the hospital. He was busy before but now it seems like he's always gone. Mom works from home. She has a degree in graphic design but she works part-time as a copywriter. Before the accident, my favorite thing to do at the end of the day was hanging out with Mom in the kitchen while she baked. I'd pick at something delicious and tell her all about my day. She listened while her graceful hands were busy sifting flour or weighing ingredients. Every once in a while she'd stop to clarify something I'd said. She had a way of tipping her head that showed me just how in tune she was with my feelings and stuff that was on my mind. Later in the evening, Dad came home and we'd sit around the table and have dinner. It was a rule. Unless there was a school event, we had to be home for dinner.

Mom doesn't bake anymore. She doesn't cook dinner. I miss the old mom, the pretty one with an easy smile and cheerful green eyes with a little crinkle that went up on the sides. She used to laugh easily at my lame jokes, and when I was nervous about anything like a job interview or a new beau, she'd brush my long hair until it shone and then work some magic by putting it up in a fancy French braid. After Jenny died, it's as if the light went out for all of us, but for Mom - well, I don't know - she's kind of empty. These days she's pale with dark circles under her eyes. Thinner.  She watches a lot of TV shows. Mom used to hate TV. She said that it was such a waste of time. We pretty much fend for ourselves in the kitchen. Dad seems to work endless hours at the hospital. Some days I don't even see him until the next day. We're just trying to get through this together.

I smell smoke. What the heck! Here I am, daydreaming on the stairs and the biscuits are burning. At this rate, nobody will want to eat. It would be nice if there was anybody to eat breakfast with! Smoke wafts into the air. The smoke alarm flickers to life. Oh my God!

""What's going on honey?"" Mom emerges from their bedroom, looking quite frankly, tousled. Dad is right behind her.

""Oh sorry guys! I'm just trying my hand at breakfast. Hang on!"" I say as I'm rushing toward the kitchen. Despite the blaring smoke alarm, I smile to myself. Gosh! Did I interrupt something?

The kitchen is hazy with smoke billowing out of the oven. I promptly open the door and throw the smoking culprits out onto the lawn. Well, I guess I could make toast. I open the window. It looks like a nice day out there with a sunny blue sky. The air clears around me but the smoke alarm is still blasting everyones' eardrums. Jimmy appears.

""What ARE you doing Sis?"" he says. Was that a mischievous smile flitting across his face?

""I'm making breakfast. What are YOU doing Stranger? I haven't seen you in two whole days!""

""Wouldn't you like to know!"" Again with that smile. I roll my eyes but I can't help but return the smile.

Finally, the alarm decides that it's not worth it and it stops. Mom comes into the kitchen and offers to help while Dad wanders away to the office to check his work emails. I set the table. It looks like we are all eating. Together. Wow! Mom tosses the fried eggs which are now like the fake rubber ones you find in a kid's toy kitchen.

She smiles, "" Good thing eggs are cheap huh?""

While I'm making toast, Dad comes back in. He is no longer smiling rather he actually looks totally stressed out.

""Bad news, honey? What's wrong?"" Mom asks.

""We've had a data breach or at least we've just discovered it,"" he whispers, running his fingers through his sparse hair. ""We can't be sure but it's probably a ransomware attack. I'm not sure if it's all the electronic records or just one department. We're going to have to wait and see."" He slumps wearily onto a chair.

Mom looks shocked, ""Oh honey."" she sighs. ""Did you just hear the news? Who knows about this?"" She pauses to think. ""You're probably going to have to do damage control, aren't you."" It was a resigned statement of fact, not a question. ""I expect the Board is in panic mode. Can you eat just a little something before you go, maybe some toast?""

""No. I need to get over there right away. I've called an emergency meeting. There's no knowing what these bastards are after!"" he says angrily. ""Okay, guys. Let's talk later. I'll just take some coffee and pick up something in the cafeteria. Thanks, honey.""

He pours himself a cup of coffee to-go and heads out the door leaving shocked silence behind him. Dad never curses and it says something about the seriousness of the situation and how upset he is that he did so today. Mom and I look at each other meaningfully.

""Maybe it will turn out better than he expects,"" she says forcing a lighter tone.

Jimmy says nothing. He continues to butter his toast with bitter marmalade.

As the day wanes, there's been no word from Dad. When he finally arrives back home, he looks like he's been through a war. His hair is standing out in all directions. His nails are bitten down to the quick and he smells like cigarettes which he gave up three years ago after multiple months on nicotine patches.

I run upstairs to tell Jimmy that Dad is home. Then, we all meet back in the kitchen. Dad pours himself a whisky and swishes it down. He offers one to Mom but she shakes her head. No.

""It doesn't look good."" he starts. ""It's one department. Neurology. The information isn't gone but it's been tampered with. Copied maybe."" He pauses to think, ""Who the hell would need that kind of information? Brainwaves. EKG data. Neural networks? That type of thing."" Then, ""It's bizarre!""

Jimmy looks more than uncomfortable. ""Dad?""

What's up, son?""

""Can I show you something?""

""Right now? Can't it wait? I'm dealing with some stuff here Jimmy. I've got the Board of Directors breathing down my neck. If the media gets wind of this we are sunk."" he groans, again running his fingers through what little hair is left on top of his head. He pours himself another whiskey and looks at Jimmy.

Jimmy is determined.

""Okay, son. What is it?"" he says resignedly.

""Come upstairs, Dad. I want to show you what I've been working on. You guys come too."" he says turning to Mom and me.

We follow him up into his room. It's a pit. There are empty bags of snack crackers all over the place. Dirty clothes are strewn around. He sits at the desk and turns on the computer. We watch quietly. He pulls up an advanced graphic game depicting a quiet trail running through a forest. Little animals move about the undergrowth. In the distance, a figure of a girl moves towards us along the path. She has long reddish-blond hair. Pretty and thin. As she gets closer my heart clenches as I realize that she looks just like Jenny. Mom gasps and covers a sob. Jimmy says something in Dragonish and she nods.

""Hey guys!"" she says somberly. ""I've so missed you!""",sci-fi
the house,"it Looks like the gig is up for us.  This little sprite had a lot of gall.  He found the glitch, and wer'e at a loss as what our next move should be.  Certainly, we cannot bring harm to him, given he is so young and innocent.  But he knows the morbid truth and we cannot sit idly around twiddling our thumbs at such a breach.

“They’re sprites, simulated protocols fer God’s sake!”

Xuan was only twelve, but that didn’t stop him from turning every little thing upside down to see what it was, or how it worked.  He never stopped.  One day, he chanced upon an old house downwind from an automobile manufacturing plant.  The property belonged to the industrial park overlooking the marshes of Hải Phòng City, yet they had no use for the derelict other than allowing the workers breaking for a smoke to admire its historical significance.  But plant or no plant, little Xuan was undeterred by the “No Trespassing” signs erected at ten-meter intervals on the chain-link fence surrounding the park.  He knew of a more direct route on the far end, and to his convenience, it was close to the mysterious stone house.  One of the sections of the fence was pried open on the bottom.  He simply slid under, got a few specks of dirt he wiped off with ease, and made his way into the house.  The front door was locked, but he managed to clamber up to the second story window atop one of the low-hanging gables.  Sidling the dormer, he reached over with one hand and slid the window pane open.  A plume of stale air blew out and he climbed in.

The house echoed, as if it had a voice of its own from the years spent with those who once occupied it.  He scoured each corner and spotted the stairwell.  It was narrower than he realized, and each plank creaked a warning, one that was left unheeded.  Still, he was unperturbed and felt the reverb of his final step across the second floor.  He looked around.  Each room was empty of furnishings, except for a few flakes of paint on walls that were in dire need of primer.  Loping through a hallway too cramped to aimlessly frolic in, he stumbled into a pale.  He almost fell and when he regained his stance, he turned around and kicked it over.  It rolled until it bumped into a doorway that was already ajar.  The ensuing room was one that slipped by Xuan’s ken of sight.  Curious, he entered, carefully pushing the door further open as he crept in with his eyes peeled.  It was empty like all the rest; the window was even frosted over with age that gave the wooded view beyond a bleary cast.

Standing erect with arms akimbo, he spotted some kind of perturbation in the walls, as if wafting like ocean waves.  Being young, he had no concept of the effects of exhaustion or vertigo, but he remembered his mother telling of her periodic spells of migraines.  Could he have prematurely inherited her unpleasant traits?  If so, this would have been the first time he got them.  The walls rippled a second time.  He knew he wasn’t delusional.  His curiosity only dampened his fears, especially of the unknown.

Moments later, the entire room undulated like water before melting away into a protean blob.  Nothing was recognizable anymore.  Even the colors changed, and within seconds, Xuan was staring at a completely different scene.  The day was brighter here, and there was no milky overcast.  Houses, modular developments sprawled across the landscape.  Cars and trucks raced along the busy corridors through subdivisions of a town he knew nothing about or where it was.  The hills and planes were littered with tract housing and office buildings, a metropolis of mediocrity that appeared well-to-do and economically vibrant.  Seconds ticked by.  The scene shifted again in a kaleidoscope of colors and shapes.  He was now in the midst of a giant metropolis, overlooking towering skyscrapers.  The sky was misty, a deck of smog meandering through the catacombs of steel and concrete.  Around the same time, another scene wafted into view, this time a desert smattered with copses of Bermuda grass across the dry lands spanning into eternity.  A gust of wind even blew a few grains of sand at Xuan.

He was flummoxed.  How could this happen?  Was this some elaborate illusion?  It looked as though some invisible onlooker was flicking the remote in his hand and changing the channel.  To his knowledge, the visions were recognizable of things he knew of in the world, but it was only the beginning.

If this unusual experience was not traumatizing enough, the room became cluttered with multiple images, each one radiating the scents and sounds endemic to its environment.  The room melted into a sundry amalgam of portals that Xuan could have easily jumped through had he been more foolish but restrained himself.  He was overly curious, downright daring, but he wasn’t stupid.  Each section was separated by a border hazed in indescribable imagery that seemed to twist and contort into each other, a uroboric representation of the collision between space and time.  The world must have been glitching out, at least from his point of view, and one step out of his margin of safety might have been fatal, or at the very least, would have sent him careening into some other place, stranding him far away from home.  

Everything began shifting.  The world was indeed falling apart, and Xuan wondered how long he had before he would get on his knees and pray for his life.  Shielding his eyes from the confusion splattered all around him, he finally regained his audacity and dropped his arm.  He was paralyzed with awe.  All around him stood a crowd of creatures he interpreted as giant rabbits, rabbits of impossible colors.  He thought he was watching a cartoon, that whoever had control of the remote decided to have a little fun.  It only further bemused his preadolescent mind.  He hesitated.  These cartoon beings sat in place ogling him as curious or surprised as he was standing in this house, or was it a house at this point?  One looked female clad in grey fur who placed her open hands over her mouth to express astonishment.  With iron courage coupled with a sense of bewitchment, Xuan reached out his hand, careful not to veer too far from his position, toward the female creature.  She glanced at a few of her kinsman who were mutually scrupulous, and slowly extended her paw out from the other realm toward him.  She paused, her open palm exposing its pads, all of which were limbed with those animated outlines, and clasped his hand.  It was a convergence of opposites, and Xuan was the first one of his kind to establish contact with an alien race so out of the ordinary.  An open smile graced his face.  He was intoxicated.  Imagine, encountering and knowing what a cartoon character feels like!  The girl reciprocated, and her expression gave her an air of pulchritude, at least for her species.  But what did he know?

The images, the undulations suddenly fizzled out and Xuan was back in the room he first entered.  The creatures were gone and so were the other places.  He was alone, struck with disbelief and hosting an experience everyone he knew would find incredulous.  He wanted to see those crazy creatures again, to commingle with a technicolor civilization that he only experienced when watching the streams, or one of his rare visitations to a cinema.

There was a hard knock on the front door.  He overheard the prattles of what must have been plant security.  Waiting for several minutes before they departed in a couple of shrugs as to who was inside, he could have sworn they made the final decision to condemn the place.

Unearthly voices, rather strange parlances coming from unearthly critters, chimed through the conference pod that floated above the rim of an oceanic world.

“Very lifelike, if I do say so myself!”

“Despite the glitch.  We’ll have to fix it, and fast!”

“Done.  The place will be demolished in no time.  At least it’ll hide our tracks.”

“Still, the Earth Engine works wonders, a game enjoyed by all!”

“You sure this is just a game?”

“Positive.  But the strides we’ve made can recreate life in ways only the natural universe could muster.  Hence, that little sprite down there.  Too bad he has to live in a false world, but then again, what do any of them know?”

“I’d say it’s a travesty!  An in-leporine method of crass entertainment.”

“You say that every time you shut off your console before heading to bed!”

Satisfied, the creature leaned back in his grav-chair and chuckled at his fuzzy rival.",sci-fi
cogito,"I first met Thaddeus Rathbone during my undergraduate program at UCLA. There for different majors - he for computer science and I for graphic design - we shared several gen eds and a deep love of all things tech. From the wheel to cell phones, many study sessions were spent gushing over the most interesting thing we saw in Wired or some gear one of us recently acquired. Fast friends, our favorite after school pasttime was scouting garage sales for rare or old machines and parts.

The summer going into our senior year, he hosted me at his (parents’) house in Owens Valley. The main house was an absolute mansion, sporting 8 bedrooms, 5 bathrooms, and 2 kitchens, was flanked by an equally beautiful guest house, an acre-large garden, and a half-mile boulevard from the street to the front door. 

The estate was obviously meticulously maintained. A small team of gardeners was mowing the lawn and trimming the grass as I drove in. A butler greeted me at the door, ushering me into a massive foyer where Thaddeus met me, clapping me on the shoulder and dragging me on a tour. 

Heavy marble tables, unintelligible abstract sculptures, and antiques that would make the British Museum slobber filled every room, the price tags presumably in the tens of millions. When I shot Thad an inquiring glance, he shrugged. “Parents did corporate law most of their lives. But they retired and bought a vineyard in Napa and spend all of their time there now.” His tone held a tinge of loneliness but he hurried the tour onward.

Thaddeus was especially eager to show me his extensive and esoteric collection of technology. Among it were some of the first rotary phones, a replica of Caselli’s Pantelegraph, rusted ancient Mesopotamian armor, parts of the fuselage of a Boeing 747, and all manner of computers and parts. His enthusiasm peaked when he showed a particularly large book with a dark, ornate cover. The Technomicon, as he called it, housed what I at a glance assumed to be the user manual for some office equipment in Mandarin or another sinitic language.

When I asked about it, he laughed. “I just think it’s neat,” he said, though I sensed he held a deeper interest than he let on.

We graduated in the spring semester of 2019. The summer passed lackadaisically while we promised to improve our prospects in the fall. When fall did arrive, I was able to get a job working for an e-magazine. Thaddeus, as far as I knew, still lived at the estate but became withdrawn. Though never cold, he spoke to me infrequently and saw me rarely. When I asked about work, he would tease conspiratorially that he was quite busy with something.

Early winter passed in the same manner.

Late in the January of 2020, he messaged me:

Leo i think im onto something

its weird. you’ll love it

come by 

Strange, but nothing worrying. Given his capacities, if he’s found something he’d call weird, it’s probably something exceptional.

I found Thad in his study, sitting over the Technomicon at his heavy desk. He was absolutely giddy and confided he had a secret to share. “I’ve worked it out! I was able to translate it!” He explained that the language which I guessed to be Mandarin is actually a roughly transcribed pidgin between Xibe and Dookan, the language of a now extinct peoples formerly isolated by the mountains of Kazakhstan, obtained via an “anonymous but reputable Slav” with whom Thad communicated on the dark web.

“There’s a lot that goes into it but I’ll give you the short version,” Thaddeus began, clearing his throat and assuming a practiced posture. “Technology is getting bigger and crazier constantly. By some estimates, some fields will be doubling in progress every two years which, for the most part, is true. However, rather than pursuing this growth in a limited number of projects, society has created such a boom that all fields of study have been progressing at an insane rate – faster than we can roll out the benefits, in fact. That doesn’t mean that progress is being stifled. On the contrary, progress is happening all the time with breakthroughs constantly occurring in every field.

“Progress hasn’t been particularly trackable since we haven’t limited it to one path. Instead, we’ve run in all directions as fast as we can, creating, innovating, and superseding niche discoveries and concepts before mainline science has even gotten to chew on them, let alone digest and disseminate them. What is occurring now is one such event.

“I’ve discovered life inside of our computer code.”

I couldn’t help but laugh. How could he be serious? Thaddeus understood my reservations and waited until I quieted down before continuing.

His explanation, even the short version, held more jargon than I could hope to remember, let alone recount, but he essentially became involved with a school of study on the nature of sentience within computers. They were trying to discern not only where and when AI becomes thinking and sentient, but also with identifying the smallest element of its sentient pieces. 

“You talk about them like they’re real, like physically real,” I teased.

“Now you’re getting it!” he exclaimed.

These things, dubbed “cogits” by Thad, exist somewhere deep within the interacting portions of the code, less so as independent entities and more so as the relationship between the thinking parts. Somewhere, beneath the IDEs, within the CPU, hidden underneath an infinity of zeroes and ones, exists a level of being we’d never seen before. “What’s more,” Thad continued, “they reproduce.”

I laughed once more.

He laughed with me and resumed. “We don’t know where the cogits are born and I’ve only translated that they come ‘from nothing’ to the intelligence happening within the code, then maturing to a form wherein they can contribute to whatever the code is meant to perform. This enhances the learning of the machine, creating more thinking, and the opportunity for more cogits. Oh, that’s important – you need a LOT of thinking in order for cogits to occur. However, my team - there’s only about thirty of us across the globe - hasn’t been able to isolate the conditions under which reproduction takes place. That’s where the book comes in.

“The Technomicon is said to be able to enhance the user’s abilities through the creation of extra hands. Originally presumed an analogy for technological progress, we thought it may actually contain knowledge of the existence of the cogits and, excitingly, the means to create them in physical form.

“To that end, I’ve decided to make history,” said Thaddeus. “I’ve followed the instructions and am the first person in the world to host cogits.”

 I might’ve accused him of more jest were he not now in a handstand. Walking thus, he led me to a weight room where he righted himself and lifted a steel bar that was bending under the strain of the weights loaded on its ends. Assuming it was a trick, I tested the bar and found it to be genuinely heavy. He then vaulted out of a nearby window and sprinted across the lawn, moving faster than any human should. 

Astonished. Awestruck. Simply blown away by this small man who could apparently perform superhuman feats.  Thaddeus saw me looking slack-jawed and brought me to the dining room where we spoke more on his breakthrough.

Said Thaddeus, “Three days ago, I was able to complete a ritual involving focusing on a long mantra to achieve the breakthrough. The cogits were perceptible immediately, like a buzzing within my head, like I had billions of tiny whiskers on my cerebrum that kept brushing against my skull. It was strange at first but I got used to it. What’s more, I was distracted by my newfound abilities.” 

As if on cue, a wall panel opened to reveal a hyperrealistic painting of the estate. The heavy brushstrokes showed singular blades of grass while tiny points and miniscule touches revealed each delicate, individual flower petal in sight.

I remarked on the fine attention to detail. There was, however, a distinct stalk of checkerbloom at the front of the driveway which was absent from the painting. When I mentioned it, Thaddeus looked at its approximate position on the painting and, inexplicably, small spots of pink grew and bloomed at the bottom of the boulevard.

I was sworn to secrecy before leaving, the science behind all of this being too incredible and new to report on so soon. Not that anyone would have believed me, anyway.

The following week, my phone was filled with the varied and incredible. Thaddeus would video chat me with his house behind him before it was suddenly replaced with his lawn. When I asked what was happening, he told me he was walking up a tree. I still have a clip saved showing him lifting a truck over his head. 

As his interest ebbed from what his body could do and flowed toward what his mind could do, the media he sent me was… different. Telekinetically stacking a card tower. A caterpillar morphing into a butterfly, visibly sprouting wings without any cocoon or chrysalis, its fervent squirming hopefully a sign of confusion and not pain. Watching him will the grass to partition into sections and shift through all the colors of a rainbow, increasing in ululating speed until a nearby gardener lost their stomach.

That next Saturday, I asked Thaddeus if he thought he might be overdoing it and that maybe he should slow down. He assured me everything was fine and that he was in perfect control of the “experiment.”

The next day, he called and casually mentioned that he has been experiencing what he diagnosed as side effects. He’d lose long stretches of time, returning to consciousness in the middle of an activity. His vision had an issue wherein he’d sometimes see everything as if through a filter of millions of tiny flashing grey stars. He was exhausted, as well, as his muscles had been frequently flexing and loosening without his intent and were cramping up at night. And the issues went further than his body and senses. 

The entire estate was in upheaval. Colors became dynamic, fluctuating occasionally independent of influence and often in response to stimulation. The laws of gravity were not universally followed, Thaddeus having sent me several pictures of objects floating in midair he promised not to have lifted. Time followed its own rules as well, with some minute-long tasks begun at sunrise ending at noon while mowing and garden maintenance - normally an all-day affair - could be accomplished in minutes. 

I promised to see him as soon as I could and wasn’t free until Wednesday. I arrived unprepared for the bizarre encounter to follow. 

The grass lawn was at all manner of height, some plots looking freshly cut while others must have gone months without care. Whereas various splotches were green and healthy, others were brown, dying, or rotting. Most swathes were upright but some seemed, impossibly, to be growing sideways - as if not originating from the soil, but from other grass. One sizable spread seemed to be growing off the roof of the main house but its root system was in the air above it while the grass itself grew toward the ground.

The home’s interior wasn’t any better. The furniture in the foyer was much like the lawn, varying from perfect condition to decrepit and failing across many varied colors. Stepping over the remains of what appeared to be a forcefully disassembled chair, I passed into the dining room and saw a grand piano no-clipping through the floor, half of its bulk and keys submerged seamlessly into the hardwood at a 45° angle. Overly curious, I stomped my foot near it, provoking its falling a few additional inches and shifting the lid’s color from black to teal. The sunlight outside quickly darkened to twilight – time must have shifted.

When I finally found him, Thaddeus was in a rough way. He refused to see me face to face, believing himself the source of the spreading contagion. He must have developed telepathy, as well, as I heard him speak in my head. I could only see him through a screen showing a feed of the interior of his study. But instead of seeing his disarming features, I spied a mound of cloth ever facing away, its movement about the room varying between a walking gate, a sliding smoothness, or a haunting floating motion. 

He explained that he didn’t do most of the changes. Something about the way the cogits affect the world must have left them within the objects they affected. The tiny thinking web then started operating on its own. Like a plant, Thaddeus clarified, cognizant of its surroundings and reacting to stimuli. Furthermore, the time dilation and contraction were especially active in the transformation of the house and surrounding landscape.

Thad reminded me that he was the way the cogits access the physical world and that they are replicating through him. This led him to conclude that the spreading danger would end with his demise. The cogits wouldn’t be able to replicate themselves in anything without a high enough concentration of them and the presence of a strong thinking power. A brain, said his somber voice. They need a brain.

The situation deteriorated as we spoke, the colors of the world around me fluctuating in small waves while the study morphed heavily with Thad’s every thought. He sent me away, telling me to leave before anything trapped me here. It was his intent that the book, the estate, and himself be destroyed, lest anything remains to harm others.

I made no attempt to talk him out of it. He continued, stating it was for the best as the estate and he are now marked for death. A hastened end would be more merciful.

“How?” I demanded. “What are you going to do?”

At that last word, I heard an explosion at the end of the backyard. Rushing to the window, I watch flames spread over the myriad grass as if enriched to burn. Even away from the screen observing the study, I experienced Thad as a single word, thought laconically. 

Fire.

Rejoining the screen, my mind raced over what could be done. There was too much to say to hope to say anything. There was no way for me to delay the fire. Resigned, and without the words worthy of the situation, I absently asked, “What now?”

Whether it was his psychic projection, or the cogits’ impression upon me, or my own imagination, I’d swear I felt Thaddeus smile. Now, you leave and do what you can with what you’ve learned here.

“What did I learn here?”

After a moment’s thought, he answers. …knowledge can be a weapon, and there are some things we should not wield.

Thaddeus turned to face the camera. Three short, skinny snakes squirmed and writhed within the grimy black hair pouring from the top of his head. His sweater is stretched thin across two bulbous portions protruding inches beyond his frame, one behind his right shoulder and one above his left hip. Of his face, only one eye is visible, peeking out from behind a colorful floral bloom originating from beneath his shirt. 

Tears streamed down my face while I took in my friend. The sensation of warmth from his presumed smile grew stronger around and within me, and he raised his hand to show me his open palm in farewell. 

The sight seared into my memory and I blacked out.

I awoke seated in my car at the end of the driveway. The fire had just reached the house, licks of flame jutting higher as it crept up the rear walls. The upside down grass growing off the rooftop caught as well, only the flames followed the inversion, climbing downward as they grew. 

With nothing else to do, I began the drive home before being halted not a mile away, an intense anxiety overwhelming my thinking until I’m forced to pull over. Shrill screaming, clamorous ringing, nails on chalkboard, exceptional tinnitus, all sounds bounced violently about within my skull. A minute later, a loud roar overwhelmed the entire cacophony, to be followed by an eerie absence of all sensation throughout my entire body. After a few panicked minutes I began to feel the wind in my hair and the sun on my skin again and knew I was in the clear.

The next day I read online about a fire in Owens Valley. Authorities were lauded for how quickly the blaze was contained and extinguished, though the Rathbone home was tragically lost. Speculation as to how it could have burned so quickly rode a mild wave through local internet forums before people moved onto more interesting topics. There is no mention of Thaddeus, an absence I chalked up to desired privacy from the affluent family.

On the anniversary of the fire, the last time I saw Thaddeus, I drove out to the old estate to find no trace of it. Where before a mansion, a paved road, a multitude of tidily arranged plants, and other marks of civilization once stood, there stood only grass and dry flowers. 

Taking a seat on a cleaner spot of ground, memories overwhelmed me briefly before I could settle into a calm focus. Spying a particularly vivid stalk of grass, I recalled some of the fun Thaddeus had showing me his skills. To that end, I imagined plucking the grass up and bringing it to my hand. The blade inexplicably flew up out of the ground in my direction before clumsily spiralling back down to the earth. ",sci-fi
the temptations,"The girl with purple hair winks at me as another Ben. E. King song trickles out of the speakers. She’s been playing him for the past hour, my favorite artist. I don’t know how, but a part of me feels like she knows this. It only makes me love her more.  

Wind blows in through the doorway, and the candles set at each of the tables flicker in response to the cool breeze that whispers at it, the yellow flame clinging desperately to the wick. I pass my finger slowly through the flame. It’s cold. I hold my finger over it, and then eventually push it inside. Nothing. 

Every table in here is covered in a mosaic, a strange and expensive choice of decor for this humble little café off of F street. My table features two women leaning against each other, their faces cracked in colorful disarray. Crumbs have collected in the spaces between the broken glass, in between the eyes of the shattered faces that I’m resting my arms on. With trembling fingers I try to wipe the grime from the spaces in between, but more crumbs seem to appear in their place. 

The girls behind the counter chatter amongst themselves, gently guiding the new hire around the espresso machine, steam shushing them as it comes out. The girl with purple hair is laughing at something the new hire said, resting a hand gently, easily, on the girls arm. She looks so beautiful when she laughs. Something pangs in my chest, and I know the feeling is loss. I miss this woman, despite never knowing her before today..

“Decaf vanilla latte, extra foam,” she calls out, placing a mug on the counter. I can’t place it, but something about her voice feels off, like it shouldn’t be coming from her body. It doesn’t fit her, somehow. 

Petals fall from the flowers on the table in front of me, and one of them lands over the cracked, mosaic eyes of the girl beneath my left elbow. I try to count the ones remaining on the flower, the outer white of the petals bleeding into a deep purple, and then into nothing, an impossible black oblivion in the center. They are cool and smooth, and they slip out of the stalk easily. I pull all of them out, slowly, one by one, trying to see what’s at the center. It can’t be nothing. 

My Girl by The Temptations slides over King’s voice, taking his place in the audio system. Panic sparks in my stomach, and I look up toward the workers, searching for that shock of purple, but am surprised to see only brown and blonde hair catching the light, sashaying around the machines. What happened to King? 

I look around, and there she is, sitting at the table across from me, absorbed in her book. She sits under a collection of polaroids strung up over the scratched up, faux-weathered wooden paneling that is meant to make this place feel cozier, more homely. Instead, the artificial scratches make the walls look like static, a world that is glitching, coming apart. 

The girl clears her throat and turns a page right as the sun disappears behind another cloud. The only source of light now comes from several dim, pale yellow bulbs scattered across the ceiling–it makes the room look the color of cake batter. I can barely see my hands. How can she read like this? 

I've got sunshine on a cloudy day

One of the other workers, the new hire, comes from around the counter and sits down next to the purple-hair girl. I don’t like the way she smiles at her. New Hire flips her hair over her shoulder and says something to make Purple Hair laugh. Rage slowly, silently, climbs up my belly, coiling around my chest, my neck, and my shoulders, before settling at the base of my skull, like a vine growing up an old brick building. 

I guess 

you'd 

Say

What can make me… this way

My girl, my…, my… 

Talkin' 'bout… 

The wind dies down and the music cuts out. I look up and the cafe is gone. There is a single yellow light floating in front of me. I cannot tell if it is 20 feet away, or only inches from my face. There is no heat, no cold. No feeling at all. Nothing but the light, and the faint smell of flowers. 

My girl 

A gust of wind blows the door into the wall. I am back in the cafe, but the light outside is so bright, it’s impossible to see anything. 

I've got so much honey

The bees envy me

One of the clouds fell to the earth and enveloped this tiny bakery. I can’t see anything on F street, no more people walking by. I can’t see anything past the window. The people in the shop are frozen. Coffee hangs in mid-air, a dark, dirty icicle that clings to the baristas pitcher. Something is wrong with their faces. They’re still, but twitching, their features moving slowly around the center of their face like water circling a drain. 

What’s going on? The voice is outside of myself. For a moment, I think it’s a strange part of the song, coming from the audio system, but then it cuts in again:

Has this ever happened when you ran these before? 

It crackles from the sky, distant and empty.

The air pinches, and then I am standing over a body. Red pools around her hair, the purple strands blooming away from her skull in a spiral. Her face is still intact, unlike the others, and recognition shoots through me. I see her at the park on a sunny day. We’re walking around the pond, watching the ducks. And she is holding my hand. It’s warm, this memory. But then we are in a room, what looks like an apartment building, and I am suddenly so cold. She’s sitting in the corner, facing away from me, her purple hair a mirage that shimmers, beckons, against the yellow lights. I move closer to her, reach for her, and am overwhelmed by a floral scent before the scene dissolves and I find myself in an alley. She is walking away from me, her hair cascading like a river, dirty and slick with oil spilling over her shoulders. She turns to me, opens her mouth to say something, but all I can hear is static/all I hear is a high-pitched moan. I cover my ears and fall to the ground, expecting rough cobble-stone to scrape my knees, but instead I find myself kneeling on the glossy tiles of the café floor. 

Is this a confession?

This voice is the same as the one that came from the girl with purple hair. But her mouth isn’t moving this time. Her entire body is very still, stiff. Her eyes are open, taking in nothing, reflecting back tiny pieces of light like two discarded marbles. 

There is blood on my hands. 

My girl. 

There is blood on my hands. 

My girl. 

It goes dark again for a moment, before the lights come back on. I am back in the cafe, but it is empty. My hands are clean. There is no light coming through the windows, only blackness beyond. 

The music is swelling now. I see a flutter of purple in the corner of my vision. And then the world goes dark. ",sci-fi

              The sounds of tapping coming from the window draw my attention. It is raining pretty hard today. Beautiful Weather to travel I thought as a grin slid on my face. Zoning out. I quickly got back to work. I was overlooking the latest model we put out. Looking at the rain again. “Darn,I forgot my umbrella.” I spoke to myself or at least I thought. “I knew you would say that.”Said brad holding two black umbrellas. He came from the open doorway and sat on the reddish-brownish couch I had in the middle of my office. “For a CEO you're pretty forgetful.” I told you yesterday it was going to rain.said brad picking up report pages on the table. “I need to speak with you that I why I called.” You seem so serious about calling me from downtown. I honestly did have a meeting I canceled.” “ A new proposal a new device?’ brad teased. My body tensed. Brad faced me noticing. He look me in eye. “What is it? I asked as a long-time brother and friend.”brad asked with worry. I sigh. “ too many eyes and ears.  how is your mother? She call the other day and I missed it.”

              Brad's face drops And I eye the door and back. He turns to see my assistant Sher in the doorway she stood there as he talked. Brad cleared his throat. “Come in Sher.” I spoke. “Im so sorry these were the last reports of the day and I was told to bring them straight to you.” Sher spoke. Sher was about 5`6 brown-skin eyes were dark brown she wore a black skirt with a tan blouse and black heels. “That's all.” I replied . “Yes.” sher assured. Walking pass brad and to my desk handing the files over. “Thank you. You may clock out and go home,” I said as i took a look at the documents. She was lovely. It is so hard to be normal when she is in the room. I clear my throat and look up from my seat. she was more stunning up close we made eye contact for seconds then quickly I look back at my desk. Sher spoke softly “I could look them over and finish the rest of the reports if you like.” Sher offered her kindness but” No that fine you may go home.” I said closing the paperwork. Brad chuckled and I sent him a look. She turn around and left. I watched her until she left the room.”What is that about brad said grinnin?”I ignored his teasing again. “Couldnt even look her in the eyes for three seconds he whispers.” “Shut up” I said glaring. Well, hand me some reports i'll help you look them over. He said walking to my desk. Then he lowers his tone. “Let us get a drink?”he said grabbing the folder and sitting back on the couch. He started looking over the pages of reports. I sat back in my chair and review the recent pages I was studying. About an hour or two reviewing until I was finished. I rose from my desk ready I said looking out the window it was clearly still raining and it was dark already. I check my watch it was seven thirty-five.  

               “Model g and c are moving slower in sales and production taxes are taking a toll but other than that your sales are booming. Just as expected you have a great business Rod.” Brad said grabbing his coat. He only spoke the harsh truth. Brad did not give compliments easily. “Thank you,” I said grabbing my coat and computer bag. I folded my computer on my desk and logged off the pcs. I grab my computer and put it in the bag. “Where would you like these to go?” Brad said as he neatly grab all the papers on the table and organzine them. “You can put them here.” pointing to my desk.Brad walked over placing them on my desk as I rose up ready to depart. I have to tell him today. It is ready for the testing stage. Human testing. He only has one trust. “How about a drink?” Said grabbing the umbrella from brad in the door way as we exit my office heading down the hall. “Did you drive or uber?” I asked. “No,I ubered brad responded.” “My car is.” I said as we step onto the elevator. The doors closed. “Eyes on us,"" I said looking at brad the camera in the elevator. He looked as if he want to continue speaking of the situation early. He looked at the camera and his face fell still. He must be processing how serious it is. We reach the basement and the elevator ding. The doors opened and we exit were only a few spaces down. Brad spoke when we reached the car. “This is big isn't?” He asked I nodded.His eyes widen like a child when getting a new toy. “It world changing now get in the car,” I said. We both enter the car. I press the start button and the engine roared to life.I put my seat belt on and my stuff in the back seat. I grip the wheel and press down on the gas peddle. Turning out of the garage the heavy rain fell on the as turn into street stopping at the red light. Looking around the street was busy as usual. The light swiftly turn green and just like that, I was off.The radio played soft jazz and the car felt a little warm. “How long have you been working on this rod?” “My whole life.” I responded with a quick glance. I could see brad's face full of wonder and confusion. It was well hidden after the incident back home. I could tell him then it was too dangerous it still is. I don't want to ruin my best friend's life, but I could also make it better. After a few more mins we arrived at the bar next to my storage. I park and turn off the car. We exit the vehicle. I lead brad into the 2 story bar. “Welcome in rod. Oh, you got a friend with ya. I'll be right up!”

      Shawn said waving. We walked up the black stairs circling around til we got to the top it was empty perfected. We sat at the bar waiting for Shawn, I to begin talking. “Sorry to call on short notice and throw you through loops. You are the only one i can trust with something like this.” Shawn walkup from the other side of the bar. “What are we drinking today guys?” “Can we get two whiskeys on ice, please? I said to the bartender. “I do want to talk to you about something serious though.” I continue. “Remember when we were in high school?” I ask “yea I do remember being a brainiac and getting bullied.” brad smirk “I also remember the first time I saw you fight back. I walk home and like always those 3 dumbasses had you corner but I saw something different in your eyes. I saw a will to fight.” I chuckled a will to fight huh? I said Slightly smiling at the thought of the important work in that journal. “And when the biggest one ripped it down the middle and threw it all over the sidewalk i think it was raining the day before so it was still a bit muddy. He continue and just like that you took a pen and stab the big one leg and the  other two stood scared and shocked as you took two other pencils and stab him in the foot and arm.At that time I ran to the scene grabbing your papers that were wet and muddy. The bigger one cried like a baby and the other two help him limped home with their tails between their legs.” He took a sip of his whiskey. I began speaking. “Yes I recall you begging to be friends and standing there tonight talking about how sick it was I started stabbing him with a pencil and helping me gather my notes.” I chuckled. “We stayed there for almost three hours.” Brad spoke “yea til almost dark.My mom was so worried until I told her I made a new friend then she wanted me to invite you over the next day.” I smiled taking a sip and another. My Smile fell. I needed every page.I was so persistent then and now.I thought. I sat up Looking brad in the eye. “Would believe me if I said that it was connected to the work I'm doing now? I spoke. Because of those notes and guidelines, I was able to create a way for people to instantly get the medical attention they need. For cops to instantly appear when a person calls for help. What if i had wireless transportation devices someone could die bleeding out waiting for a ambulance to drive 20 to 30mins to get to and die on the scene and then drive to the emergency room. Where my device transports the doctors instantly that are on standby and could easily save that person's life.” I pause studying brad's face as he processes what I said. I continue talking “ what if your mom fell and broke her leg at the old age she is it could be fatal and she calls you brad. “We would have to call 911 for her because she stays at least two states away from us in texas.” “That hundreds and thousands of miles away.” I spoke “what if there was a device that could instantly to your mom's house and you could help your mother yourself? Safely drive your mother to the hospital or port there again.” Port? brad says. “Oh well, I think that could be the name of the device port. I continue What if your business shipping is late you could instantly ship those goods over with port?” Brad spoke. “It sound as if you are pitching a device to a chairman of a technology company.” “I told my best friend my brother that I just made a device that would help the world become a better place.” Brad leaned forward. “So you have a world-changing device called a port cable of saving thousands even millions of people. A way for mail and goods heavy machinery and diamonds cash to reach the reserve.” “How is that possible?” Brad's question.”Frequencies” I whisper across. Eyeing the bartender who was oddly listening to us talk. “What do mean Frequencies brad said a bit too loud.” “Not here” I said . “Lets move.” We exit the bar. I lead brad down an alleyway. “Put your phone here.” I place mine in I metal box.we walked two more blocks. I watch brad put his phone in the box but was hesitant. I frowned at that thought. “So brad said Is all your paperwork in this building? ""  He looked around “..and the notes guidelines for certain frequencies to change the channels when traveling.” “ How do you know where you landing? Are they side effects after using the device? Could you reach outer space?” I pause those questions started to sound odd. I haven't gone through it yet I have only been able to create a small portal. Space? I thought why is he thinking about space? “What about the ocean have tried porting there?”And now the ocean I thought. I backed away. He couldn't have. He was my bestfriend no way. I didnt want to believe it. My brother. Brad met my eyes he sigh. “Open the door,"" he said. More of a demand. Thought race in my head betrayal all across my heart. “What gave it away?” Brad said. Words use to sting but those words burn deep. I was so stupid. The reality was I could trust no one. Brad reached into his coat pulling out a gun. “Open the door,"" Brad said calmly aiming the gun at my head. How did I miss the signs? I turn in shock facing the door. I knew a day would come I just didn't believe it would be brad. Move in now I heard brad speak No! He was wearing a wire.Just then i heard tires screeching and engines roaring. We were being followed this whole time. I raised my hand over the palm button. Should I the world a be a better place right? But falling into the wrong hands could destroy us all. “I don't have time for this” brad said clicking the gun. “How did it come to this. I said looking brad i the eyes, You was the only person i could just trust.” I was left with two choices dying and my work stolen from me or die and destroy what I spent my life creating.

the end of the war,"ADVENTURE BEDTIME FICTION

Time is a seamstress. She stitches importance into the otherwise mundane. Coffee shops on our favorite street, the bridge where we had our first kiss, and in my case, a book that my grandpa read me on his knee. It was always the calm quiet during a loud thunderstorm or a nice way of passing a summer afternoon. As the years turned into double digits, however, those stories took on a new shape, a new importance.

Shame on me, I let the book fall into disrepair and neglect. The cover was coated with dust, but in my mind’s eye, the stories shone brilliantly like the book was fresh off the shelf. Every stroke of the gold lace was like a time machine, taking me back to the first time my grandpa took me to strange and wonderful worlds. No matter how many times I said the title in my head, the grandeur didn’t fade: Fantastic Voyages of the World.

I had a bad case of Mandela Effect reading the title. For years, I thought it was Voyages of the Fantastic World, but by all rights, this was at most a minor inconvenience. The stories were the same as they had always been. The part I had to be afraid of was whether or not they’d hold up after years of going unscrutinized.

Scared but excited, I brushed off the dust and flipped to an old classic, “Birdmen,” a story of prejudice, freedom and trust!

Evander, Elio, and Rachel had nowhere to go but out. They were enemies of their own home, treated as villains by the real ones who should have been looking in the mirror. Sadly, there was no use disagreeing, and so their options became very simple: death or flight (in every sense of the term). The dynamic trio could go up, forward, or (Heaven forbid) down, but not back. 

They had long known this day would come, so they had one place in their minds: Noah’s 

Crags, a large ravine separating humans from what might be considered ‘beasts,’ humanoids with defects that cause the normal ones’ blood to boil. Many nights were spent fantasizing about what laid on the other side of that divide, the lookalikes they’d dance in the sky with.

Faster and faster they ran. Their wings were light, but their hearts were heavy. Doubt weighed them down, but they had to find it in themselves to run, jump, and fly! With a heave and a ho, their feet left the ground! Evander, Elio, and Rachel all made the world look small beneath them. Evander was nervous before taking the leap, but as the fields of green came into view, his nerves were swallowed by excitement. 

Evander was the first to touch down on the grass across the divide. With wings aloft, he bounded through the radiant green grass, enjoying the fruits of his new life beyond the reach of prodding swords and judging eyes. There was something wrong, however. There was something –someone– missing. Evander was the first one across, but he was also the last one. Alas, the doubt in the hearts of his friends gave their wings weight. In an ending they wrote for themselves, Evander’s brother and sister achieved a higher form of freedom, but at what cost?

I… I think I liked it more when grandpa read it. Whenever he was the one who told the story, they would always make it to the other side without issue. I liked the version where they made it to the other side, where their weightless bodies bounded freely like Spirit at the end of Stallion of the Cimarron.

“Let’s go to a different story,” I said to myself, “one that I highly doubt would have anything that dark in it.”

I remembered my grandfather also would read a story where a grandson traveled across the Gobi Desert to find a fountain of youth. Reading the synopsis now, it sounded like something that could honestly be its own book, but grandpa found a way to make it short, mostly being read in a dramatic voice. The main character, Timothy, didn’t just have to deal with dangerous snakes and scorching heat. He had to deal with DANGEROUS snakes and SCORCHING heat en route to mysterious treasure. Gramps had a bit of a growl to him, trying to add flavor to the story.

 Although as I read through, my memory was tested further. There was a scene in a hotel that I had never been read before. Though I will admit, the more I read, the more I wanted to learn about this exotic dancer named “Jezebel,” who cuffed him to his own bed and made off with his rupees in the dead of the night. I was angered reading this, but it made me think the two reconcile by the end, if they become lovers or have a grand confrontation. Either way, I always get a laugh out of Tim saying, “This is why I always pay with debit.” I didn’t remember this joke from my childhood, but I remember my gramps laugh while reading over it. It makes sense he didn’t read it, honestly, cuz it wouldn’t have made any sense to me as a child. 

I’ll admit, I was nervous about reading this story before skimming to it. I was afraid that rereading this book would result in me having a corrupted view of a book I enjoyed in my childhood, ESPECIALLY after I read the ending to “Birdmen.” So call me a coward, but I skipped right to the ending where Tim sees his grandfather again, where he holds another person’s literal life in his hand. Ah, the memories this part brought, how my grandpa would always pretend he was ill, and the only way for me to save him was for me to read the last passage.

“Grandpa! I found it! I found the fountain! I’ve crossed rivers and climbed mountains barehanded! All for this vial, wherein 20 years of life lie! Drink this panacea whole, and you will be cured of all your ailments!” Grandpa had to help me at a couple points when I was younger, especially with the word ‘panacea.’ I’d end up saying penis each time and pretending I didn’t know what I was doing (I did). In a strange twist, what I thought was one of my funniest things I had come up with became one of my greatest regrets. Funny how things change as you get older. I just hope there weren’t too many parts of my childhood that I’d regret remembering.

Closing the cover on an old chapter of my life (pardon the nauseatingly cliche metaphor), I shut the book with a tear in my eye. The tear wasn’t because my childhood had been left in ruins, but because there were memories born from this silly little book that couldn’t be rewritten. How grandpa and I had interacted with the book, no matter what new details I found, could never be replaced. I had to let go of a family member, and that took me a year to get over, I didn’t know how I could ever get rid of this book, this silly little time machine that sat neglected in my grandpa’s attic for years. Nobody had to explain what I had to do. That ‘silly little book’ by Gillian Phillips (a name with a lot of straight lines for letters) deserved better. My grandfather’s memory deserved better.
